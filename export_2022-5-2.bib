Traditional differential gene expression detecting methods work on the assumption that all cancer samples are over-expressed compared with normal samples and need to define the key criterion with the mean of sample data. In recent proposed methods, one often considers the situation that only a subgroup of cancer samples are over-expressed and only the key criterion with the median and median absolute deviation is required. We proposed a detecting method for over-expressed cancer subgroup by defining the key criterion with tri-mean and tri-mad. Numerical experiments on public microarray data indicate that the improved method outperforms the compared methods.}},

These antibodies are then used to tether the cut-and-paste transposase Tn5. Activation of the transposase simultaneously cleaves DNA and adds adapters (‘tagmentation’) for paired-end DNA sequencing. Here, we introduce a streamlined CUT\&Tag protocol that suppresses DNA accessibility artefacts to ensure high-fidelity mapping of the antibody-targeted protein and improves the signal-to-noise ratio over current chromatin profiling methods. Streamlined CUT\&Tag can be performed in a single PCR tube, from cells to amplified libraries, providing low-cost genome-wide chromatin maps. By simplifying library preparation CUT\&Tag requires less than a day at the bench, from live cells to sequencing-ready barcoded libraries. As a result of low background levels, barcoded and pooled CUT\&Tag libraries can be sequenced for as little as \$25 per sample. This enables routine genome-wide profiling of chromatin proteins and modifications and requires no special skills or equipment. The authors describe a streamlined epigenomic profiling protocol based on cut-and-paste tagmentation by the Tn5 transposase targeted to a chromatin protein of interest.}},

Errors in normalization can have a significant impact on downstream analysis, such as inflated false positives in differential expression analysis. An underemphasized feature of normalization is the assumptions on which the methods rely and how the validity of these assumptions can have a substantial impact on the performance of the methods. In this article, we explain how assumptions provide the link between raw RNA-Seq read counts and meaningful measures of gene expression. We examine normalization methods from the perspective of their assumptions, as an understanding of methodological assumptions is necessary for choosing methods appropriate for the data at hand. Furthermore, we discuss why normalization methods perform poorly when their assumptions are violated and how this causes problems in subsequent analysis. To analyze a biological experiment, researchers must select a normalization method with assumptions that are met and that produces a meaningful measure of expression for the given experiment.}},

Despite the emerging evidence related to glucose metabolism in the regulation of prenatal cartilage development, little is known about the role of glucose metabolism and its biochemical basis in postnatal cartilage growth and homeostasis. We show here that genetic deletion of the glucose transporter Glut1 in postnatal cartilage impairs cell proliferation and matrix production in growth plate (GPs) but paradoxically increases cartilage remnants in the metaphysis, resulting in shortening of long bones. On the other hand, articular cartilage (AC) with Glut1 deficiency presents diminished cellularity and loss of proteoglycans, which ultimately progress to cartilage fibrosis. Moreover, predisposition to Glut1 deficiency severely exacerbates injury-induced osteoarthritis. Regardless of the disparities in glucose metabolism between GP and AC chondrocytes under normal conditions, both types of chondrocytes demonstrate metabolic plasticity to enhance glutamine utilization and oxidation in the absence of glucose availability. However, uncontrolled glutamine flux causes collagen overmodification, thus affecting extracellular matrix remodeling in both cartilage compartments. These results uncover the pivotal and distinct roles of Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism in two of the postnatal cartilage compartments and link some cartilage abnormalities to altered glucose/glutamine metabolism.}},

Understanding the level of conservation of inter-tumor transcriptional variation across species and how it is associated with progression to metastasis will enable us to more efficiently develop effective strategies to manage OS and improve therapy. In this study, transcriptional profiles of OS tumors and cell lines derived from humans (n=49), mice (n=103) and dogs (n=34) were generated using RNA-sequencing. Conserved inter-tumor transcriptional variation was present in tumor sets from all three species and comprised gene clusters associated with cell cycle and mitosis and with the presence or absence of immune cells. Further, we developed a novel Gene Cluster Expression Summary Score (GCESS) to quantify inter-tumor transcriptional variation and demonstrated that these GCESS values associated with patient outcome. Human OS tumors with GCESS values suggesting decreased immune cell presence were associated with metastasis and poor survival. We validated these results in an independent human OS tumor cohort and in 15 different tumor data sets obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our results suggest that quantification of immune cell absence and tumor cell proliferation may better inform therapeutic decisions and improve overall survival for OS patients.}},

Several methods have been proposed and continue to be used. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the best gene expression quantification method for RNA-seq data analysis. In the present study, we used replicate samples from each of 20 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models spanning 15 tumor types, for a total of 61 human tumor xenograft samples available through the NCI patient-derived model repository (PDMR). We compared the reproducibility across replicate samples based on TPM (transcripts per million), FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped), and normalized counts using coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and cluster analysis. Our results revealed that hierarchical clustering on normalized count data tended to group replicate samples from the same PDX model together more accurately than TPM and FPKM data. Furthermore, normalized count data were observed to have the lowest median coefficient of variation (CV), and highest intraclass correlation (ICC) values across all replicate samples from the same model and for the same gene across all PDX models compared to TPM and FPKM data. We provided compelling evidence for a preferred quantification measure to conduct downstream analyses of PDX RNA-seq data. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of RNA-seq data quantification measures conducted on PDX models, which are known to be inherently more variable than cell line models. Our findings are consistent with what others have shown for human tumors and cell lines and add further support to the thesis that normalized counts are the best choice for the analysis of RNA-seq data across samples.}},

abstract = {{Benchmarking RNA-seq differential expression analysis methods using spike-in and simulated RNA-seq data has often yielded inconsistent results. The spike-in data, which were generated from the same bulk RNA sample, only represent technical variability, making the test results less reliable. We compared the performance of 12 differential expression analysis methods for RNA-seq data, including recent variants in widely used software packages, using both RNA spike-in and simulation data for negative binomial (NB) model. Performance of edgeR, DESeq2, and ROTS was particularly different between the two benchmark tests. Then, each method was tested under most extensive simulation conditions especially demonstrating the large impacts of proportion, dispersion, and balance of differentially expressed (DE) genes. DESeq2, a robust version of edgeR (edgeR.rb), voom with TMM normalization (voom.tmm) and sample weights (voom.sw) showed an overall good performance regardless of presence of outliers and proportion of DE genes. The performance of RNA-seq DE gene analysis methods substantially depended on the benchmark used. Based on the simulation results, suitable methods were suggested under various test conditions.}},

However, adopting VR for single-cell data visualization has thus far been hindered by expensive prerequisite hardware or advanced data preprocessing skills. To address current shortcomings, we present singlecellVR, a user-friendly web application for visualizing single-cell data, designed for cheap and easily available virtual reality hardware (e.g., Google Cardboard, ∼\$10). singlecellVR can visualize data from a variety of sequencing-based technologies including transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data as well as combinations thereof. Analysis modalities supported include approaches to clustering as well as trajectory inference and visualization of dynamical changes discovered through modelling RNA velocity.

Clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, a process termed “efferocytosis,” is ubiquitous in tumors and mediates the suppression of innate immune inflammatory response. Considering the massive infiltrated macrophages in osteosarcoma, efferocytosis probably serves as a potential target, but is rarely studied in osteosarcoma. Here, we verified M2 polarization and PD-L1 expression of macrophages following efferocytosis. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown were used to explore the underlying pathway. Moreover, tumor progression and immune landscape were evaluated following inhibition of efferocytosis in osteosarcoma model. Our study indicated that efferocytosis promoted PD-L1 expression and M2 polarization of macrophages. Ëfferocytosis was mediated by MerTK receptor in osteosarcoma and regulated the phenotypes of macrophages through the p38/STAT3 pathway. By establishing the murine osteosarcoma model, we emphasized that inhibition of MerTK suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the T cell cytotoxic function by increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and decreasing their exhaustion. Our findings demonstrate that MerTK-mediated efferocytosis promotes osteosarcoma progression by enhancing M2 polarization of macrophages and PD-L1-induced immune tolerance, which were regulated through the p38/STAT3 pathway.}},

However, sequencing technologies often unintentionally introduce experimental error into RNA sequencing data. To counteract this, normalization methods are standardly applied with the intent of reducing the non-biologically derived variability inherent in transcriptomic measurements. However, the comparative efficacy of the various normalization techniques has not been tested in a standardized manner. Here we propose tests that evaluate numerous normalization techniques and applied them to a large-scale standard data set. These tests comprise a protocol that allows researchers to measure the amount of non-biological variability which is present in any data set after normalization has been performed, a crucial step to assessing the biological validity of data following normalization. In this study we present two tests to assess the validity of normalization methods applied to a large-scale data set collected for systematic evaluation purposes. We tested various RNASeq normalization procedures and concluded that transcripts per million (TPM) was the best performing normalization method based on its preservation of biological signal as compared to the other methods tested. Normalization is of vital importance to accurately interpret the results of genomic and transcriptomic experiments. More work, however, needs to be performed to optimize normalization methods for RNASeq data. The present effort helps pave the way for more systematic evaluations of normalization methods across different platforms. With our proposed schema researchers can evaluate their own or future normalization methods to further improve the field of RNASeq normalization.}},

In the present study, tissues were isolated from six patients with OS, and then subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using a 10× Genomics platform. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was subsequently used to validate the subsets identified by scRNA-seq. ScRNA-seq of six patients with OS was performed prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and data were obtained on 29,278 cells. A total of nine major cell types were identified, and the single-cell transcriptional map of OS was subsequently revealed. Identified osteoblastic OS cells were divided into five subsets, and the subsets of those osteoblastic OS cells with significant prognostic correlation were determined using a deconvolution algorithm. Thereby, different transcription patterns in the cellular subtypes of osteoblastic OS cells were reported, and key transcription factors associated with survival prognosis were identified. Furthermore, the regulation of osteolysis by osteoblastic OS cells via receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand was revealed. Furthermore, the role of osteoblastic OS cells in regulating angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor-A was revealed. C3\_TXNIP+ macrophages and C5\_IFIT1+ macrophages were found to regulate regulatory T cells and participate in CD8+ T cell exhaustion, illustrating the possibility of immunotherapy that could target CD8+ T cells and macrophages. Our findings here show that the role of C1\_osteoblastic OS cells in OS is to promote osteolysis and angiogenesis, and this is associated with survival prognosis. In addition, T cell depletion is an important feature of OS. More importantly, the present study provided a valuable resource for the in-depth study of the heterogeneity of the OS TME.}},

abstract = {{Neutrophils are recognized as an essential part of the innate immune response, but an active debate still exists regarding the life cycle of these cells. Neutrophils first differentiate in the bone marrow through progenitor intermediaries before entering the blood, in a process that gauges the extramedullary pool size. Once believed to be directly eliminated in the marrow, liver, and spleen, neutrophils, after circulating for less than 1 day, are now known to redistribute into multiple tissues with poorly understood kinetics. In this review, we provide an update on the dynamic distribution of neutrophils across tissues in health and disease, and emphasize differences between humans and model organisms. We further highlight issues to be addressed to exploit the unique features of neutrophils in the clinic.}},

Termed here neutrotime, this spectrum extends from immature pre-neutrophils, largely in bone marrow, to mature neutrophils predominantly in blood and spleen. The sharpest increments in neutrotime occur during the transitions from pre-neutrophils to immature neutrophils and from mature marrow neutrophils to those in blood. Human neutrophils exhibit a similar transcriptomic pattern.

However, the role of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment remains controversial, with evidence for both pro- and anti-tumor roles. Here we review the mechanisms that regulate neutrophil recruitment and resolution at sites of tissue damage, with a specific focus on the tumor microenvironment.

The clinical, laboratory, and demographic findings of the patients were obtained from hospital records. Pre-treatment NLR, PLR, and LMR values were calculated in all patients. Diagnostic and prognostic values of pre-treatment NLR, PLR and LMR were assessed using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. For diagnostic approach, the highest significance in area under the curve (AUC) values was obtained for NLR (AUC=0.763). The AUC for PLR and LMR was statistically significant, while the statistical power was weak compared to NLR (AUC=0.681 and 0.603). The NLR, PLR, and LMR were found to be predictors of mortality. The cut-off value was found to be 3.28 for NLR, 128 for PLR, and 4.22 for LMR. The prognostic value of NLR for mortality was higher than (AUC=0.749) PLR (AUC=0.688) and LMR (AUC=0.609). The NLR, PLR, and LMR were associated with overall survival (OS). There was a significant difference in the median OS time among the NLR, PLR, and LMR values (log-rank test order p<0.001, p=0.001, and p=0.004, respectively).

This research aimed to explore the correlations between osteosarcoma prognosis and IRG signature. The inflammatory response-associated differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) were screened out through Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) databases. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were utilized to construct the IRG signature. The prognostic value of signature was investigated through Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curve and nomogram. DEmRNAs among high and low inflammatory response-associated risks were identified and functional enrichment analyses were conducted. ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment analyses (ssGSEA) were implied to reveal the alterations in immune infiltration. All the above results were validated in Target database. The expression of IRGs was also validated in different cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and osteosarcoma patient samples by immunohistochemistry. The IRG signature that consisted of two genes (MYC, CLEC5A) was established. In training and validation datasets, patients with lower risk scores survived longer and the IRG signature was confirmed as the independent prognostic factor in osteosarcoma. The nomogram was constructed and the calibration curves demonstrated the reliability of this model. Functional analysis of risk score-associated DEmRNAs indicated that immune-related pathways and functions were significantly enriched. ssGSEA revealed that 14 immune cells and 11 immune functions were significantly dysregulated. The qRT-PCR results indicated IRGs were significantly differently expressed in osteosarcoma and osteoblast cell lines. The immunohistochemistry analyses of patients’ samples revealed the same result. The novel osteosarcoma inflammatory response-associated prognostic signature was established and validated in this study.

To discover the dominant immune system archetypes, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Immunoprofiler Initiative (IPI) processed 364 individual tumors across 12 cancer types using standardized protocols. Computational clustering of flow cytometry and transcriptomic data obtained from cell sub-compartments uncovered dominant patterns of immune composition across cancers. These archetypes were profound insofar as they also differentiated tumors based upon unique immune and tumor gene-expression patterns.

The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.

The purpose of this research was to explore the potential mechanism of m6A modification level on the clinical outcome of stage III colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were adopted to reveal the signal pathway which was most likely affected by m6A methylation. The linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) method and the least absolute shrink-age and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model were used to identify the signature. The signature can sensitively separate the patients into high and low risk indicating the relapse-free survival (RFS) time based on time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Then, the multi-gene signature was validated in GSE14333 and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. The number of the samples in GSE14333 and TCGA cohort are 63 and 150. Finally, two nomograms were set up and validated to predict prognosis of patients with stage III CRC. The hematopoietic cell lineage (HCL) signaling pathway was disclosed through GSEA and GSVA. Seven HCL-related genes were determined in the LASSO model to construct signature, with AUC 0.663, 0.708, and 0.703 at 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS, respectively. Independent datasets analysis and stratification analysis indicated that the HCL-related signature was reliable in distinguishing high- and low-risk stage III CRC patients. Two nomograms incorporating the signature and pathological N stage were set up, which yielded good discrimination and calibration in the predictions of prognosis for stage III CRC patients. A novel HCL-related signature was developed as a predictive model for survival rate of stage III CRC patients. Nomograms based on the signature were advantageous to facilitate personalized counseling and treatment in stage III CRC.}},

Osteosarcoma cases with high immune score had significantly improved outcome (P<0.01). The proportions of naive B cells and M0 macrophages were significantly lower in high immune score tissues compared with the low immune score group (P<0.05), while the amounts of M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, and resting dendritic cells were significantly higher (P<0.05). Important immune-associated genes were determined to generate a prognostic model by Cox regression analysis. Interestingly, cases with high risk score had poor outcome (P<0.01). The areas under the curve (AUC) for the risk model in predicting 1, 3 and 5-year survival were 0.634, 0.781, and 0.809, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested immunosuppression in high-risk osteosarcoma patients, in association with poor outcome.}},
