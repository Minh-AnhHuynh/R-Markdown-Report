# Appendix: code

All analysis was done using _R software (v4.1.2)_. Code is available at https://github.com/Minh-AnhHuynh/Osteosarcoma-Project

Code philosophy follows ["The tidyverse style guide" written by Hadley Wickham. ](https://style.tidyverse.org/) using _styler (v1.7.0)_ to restyle code, and tidyverse environment as much as possible, substituting base R functions to their _dplyr_ and _purrr_ equivalent in order to ensure consistent code readability, usage and naming.

```{r tpm, eval=FALSE}
tpm_function <- function(counts, len) {
  x <- counts / len
  return(t(t(x) * 1e6 / colSums(x)))
}
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
