# Discussion

the purpose of the discussion is to summarise your major findings and place them in the context of the current state of knowledge in the literature. When you discuss your own work and that of others, back up your statements with evidence and citations.

- The first part of the discussion should contain a summary of your major findings (usually 2 â€“ 4 points) and a brief summary of the implications of your findings. Ideally, it should make reference to whether you found support for your hypotheses or answered your questions that were placed at the end of the introduction.
- The following paragraphs will then usually describe each of these findings in greater detail, making reference to previous studies.
- Often the discussion will include one or a few paragraphs describing the limitations of your study and the potential for future research.
- Subheadings within the discussion can be useful for orienting the reader to the major themes that are addressed.



## Limitations

- Immune deconvolutions methods do not give the same results, thus they are unclear. Only MCP Counter reports significantly different neutrophil abundance between low and high group.
- Immune deconv paper has 7 limitations [@Sturm.2019].
- Z-score and equal mean of groups may not be the best normalization method and way of making groups. Geometric mean (inspired from a package) could have been used but returned 0 value despite all values being positive.
- Literature analysis comparing normalization methods reveals library size normalization (TPM, FPKM, RPKM) methods perform worse than distribution normalization methods (DESeq2, TMM), which are recommended by @Zhao.2021. Notably, library size normalization methods assume that the total amount of mRNA per cell is identical in every condition.
- DESeq2's normalized count could have then been used, as it is possible to get it from rawcounts after performing DESeq2 analysis, using two functions, `estimateSizeFactors` and `counts(normalized = TRUE)`. However some immune deconvolution methods still expect TPM as input.
- Using DESeq2's normalized raw count as input, it is inconsistent to then use TPM in order to perform other analysis.
- Perhaps some outliers could have been removed in order to better identify clusters.
- In single-cell, one potential reason that we do not find neutrophils is because chemotherapy induces aplasia which kills off all short lives immune cells.
