Areas covered: Hypothesis: Unresolved inflammation-induced exaggerated expression of apoptotic and/or wound healing mediators lead to fundamental erosion (‘immune tsunami’ or ‘immune meltdown’) of integrity in tissues that are naturally immune-responsive (immune surveillance); or immune-privileged (immune tolerance). ‘Immune tsunami’ refers to end results of acute or chronic immune dysfunction leading to inflammatory diseases or cancer. Acute inflammatory diseases including drug-induced cancer cachexia, would fit features of ‘immune meltdown’ that are otherwise described for end results of age-associated diseases. Pathogens induce rapid destruction of vascular integrity, gain access to tissues and cause excessive expression of apoptotic factors leading to multiple organ failure (MOF). Significant disruptions of immunological barriers and response shifts lead to chronic neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, tumor growth, malignancies and angiogenesis and loss of natural immune response balances. Expert opinion: Strategies to promote (stabilize) inherent properties of innate immune cells (‘tumoricidal’ versus ‘tumorigenesis’) that would influence polarization of adaptive immune (T or B) cells are key in reducing or preventing incidence of inflammatory and vascular diseases or cancer during aging process.}},

FGFR2 signaling in OSCs initiates fibrosis, whereas the resultant fibronectin (FN) auto-deposition sustains fibrogenic reprogramming and OSC growth, resembling the process employed by non-malignant myofibroblasts to cause tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that nintedanib targets the pan FGFR-FN axis to disrupt lung metastasis without affecting the bone lesion growth of OSCs.

abstract = {{Ongoing debates, misunderstandings and controversies on the role of inflammation in cancer have been extremely costly for taxpayers and cancer patients for over four decades. A reason for repeated failed clinical trials (90\% ± 5 failure rates) is heavy investment on numerous genetic mutations (molecular false-flags) in the chaotic molecular landscape of site-specific cancers which are used for “targeted” therapies or “personalized” medicine. Recently, unresolved/chronic inflammation was defined as loss of balance between two tightly regulated and biologically opposing arms of acute inflammation (“Yin”–“Yang” or immune surveillance). Chronic inflammation could differentially erode architectural integrities in host immune-privileged or immune-responsive tissues as a common denominator in initiation and progression of nearly all age-associated neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases and/or cancer. Analyses of data on our “accidental” discoveries in 1980s on models of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases in conjunctival-associated lymphoid tissues (CALTs) demonstrated at least three stages of interactions between resident (host) and recruited immune cells: (a), acute phase; activation of mast cells (MCs), IgE Abs, histamine and prostaglandin synthesis; (b), intermediate phase; down-regulation phenomenon, exhausted/degranulated MCs, heavy eosinophils (Eos) infiltrations into epithelia and goblet cells (GCs), tissue hypertrophy and neovascularization; and (c), chronic phase; induction of lymphoid hyperplasia, activated macrophages (Mϕs), increased (irregular size) B and plasma cells, loss of integrity of lymphoid tissue capsular membrane, presence of histiocytes, follicular and germinal center formation, increased ratios of local IgG1/IgG2, epithelial thickening (growth) and/or thinning (necrosis) and angiogenesis. Results are suggestive of first evidence for direct association between inflammation and identifiable phases of immune dysfunction in the direction of tumorigenesis. Activated MFs (TAMs or M2) and Eos that are recruited by tissues (e.g., conjunctiva or perhaps lung airways) whose principal resident immune cells are MCs and lymphocytes are suggested to play crucial synergistic roles in enhancing growth promoting capacities of host toward tumorigenesis. Under oxidative stress, M-CSF may produce signals that are cumulative/synergistic with host mediators (e.g., low levels of histamine), facilitating tumor-directed expression of decoy receptors and immune suppressive factors (e.g., dTNFR, IL-5, IL-10, TGF-β, PGE2). M-CSF, possessing superior sensitivity and specificity, compared with conventional markers (e.g., CA-125, CA-19-9) is potentially a suitable biomarker for cancer diagnosis and technology development. Systematic monitoring of interactions between resident and recruited cells should provide key information not only about early events in loss of immune surveillance, but it would help making informed decisions for balancing the inherent tumoricidal (Yin) and tumorigenic (Yang) properties of immune system and effective preventive and therapeutic approaches and accurate risk assessment toward improvement of public health.}},

The chaotic karyotype of this rare tumor has precluded the identification of prognostic biomarkers and patient stratification. We reasoned that transcriptomic studies should overcome this genetic complexity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of 79 osteosarcoma diagnostic biopsies identified stable independent components that recapitulate the tumor and microenvironment cell composition. Unsupervised classification of the independent components stratified this cohort into favorable (G1) and unfavorable (G2) prognostic tumors in terms of overall survival. Multivariate survival analysis ranked this stratification as the most influential variable. Functional characterization associated G1 tumors with innate immunity and G2 tumors with angiogenic, osteoclastic, and adipogenic activities as well as PPARγ pathway upregulation. A focused gene signature that predicted G1/G2 tumors from RNA-seq data was developed and validated within an independent cohort of 82 osteosarcomas. This signature was further validated with a custom NanoString panel in 96 additional osteosarcomas. This study thus proposes new biomarkers to detect high-risk patients and new therapeutic options for osteosarcoma. Significance: These findings indicate that the osteosarcoma microenvironment composition is a major feature to identify hard-to-treat patient tumors at diagnosis and define the biological pathways and potential actionable targets associated with these tumors.}},

Despite the emerging evidence related to glucose metabolism in the regulation of prenatal cartilage development, little is known about the role of glucose metabolism and its biochemical basis in postnatal cartilage growth and homeostasis. We show here that genetic deletion of the glucose transporter Glut1 in postnatal cartilage impairs cell proliferation and matrix production in growth plate (GPs) but paradoxically increases cartilage remnants in the metaphysis, resulting in shortening of long bones. On the other hand, articular cartilage (AC) with Glut1 deficiency presents diminished cellularity and loss of proteoglycans, which ultimately progress to cartilage fibrosis. Moreover, predisposition to Glut1 deficiency severely exacerbates injury-induced osteoarthritis. Regardless of the disparities in glucose metabolism between GP and AC chondrocytes under normal conditions, both types of chondrocytes demonstrate metabolic plasticity to enhance glutamine utilization and oxidation in the absence of glucose availability. However, uncontrolled glutamine flux causes collagen overmodification, thus affecting extracellular matrix remodeling in both cartilage compartments. These results uncover the pivotal and distinct roles of Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism in two of the postnatal cartilage compartments and link some cartilage abnormalities to altered glucose/glutamine metabolism.}},

Understanding the level of conservation of inter-tumor transcriptional variation across species and how it is associated with progression to metastasis will enable us to more efficiently develop effective strategies to manage OS and improve therapy. In this study, transcriptional profiles of OS tumors and cell lines derived from humans (n=49), mice (n=103) and dogs (n=34) were generated using RNA-sequencing. Conserved inter-tumor transcriptional variation was present in tumor sets from all three species and comprised gene clusters associated with cell cycle and mitosis and with the presence or absence of immune cells. Further, we developed a novel Gene Cluster Expression Summary Score (GCESS) to quantify inter-tumor transcriptional variation and demonstrated that these GCESS values associated with patient outcome. Human OS tumors with GCESS values suggesting decreased immune cell presence were associated with metastasis and poor survival. We validated these results in an independent human OS tumor cohort and in 15 different tumor data sets obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our results suggest that quantification of immune cell absence and tumor cell proliferation may better inform therapeutic decisions and improve overall survival for OS patients.}},

Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets.

abstract = {{The poor progress of immunotherapy on osteosarcoma patients requires deeper delineation of immune tolerance mechanisms in the osteosarcoma microenvironment and a new therapeutic strategy. Clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, a process termed “efferocytosis,” is ubiquitous in tumors and mediates the suppression of innate immune inflammatory response. Considering the massive infiltrated macrophages in osteosarcoma, efferocytosis probably serves as a potential target, but is rarely studied in osteosarcoma. Here, we verified M2 polarization and PD-L1 expression of macrophages following efferocytosis. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown were used to explore the underlying pathway. Moreover, tumor progression and immune landscape were evaluated following inhibition of efferocytosis in osteosarcoma model. Our study indicated that efferocytosis promoted PD-L1 expression and M2 polarization of macrophages. Ëfferocytosis was mediated by MerTK receptor in osteosarcoma and regulated the phenotypes of macrophages through the p38/STAT3 pathway. By establishing the murine osteosarcoma model, we emphasized that inhibition of MerTK suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the T cell cytotoxic function by increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and decreasing their exhaustion. Our findings demonstrate that MerTK-mediated efferocytosis promotes osteosarcoma progression by enhancing M2 polarization of macrophages and PD-L1-induced immune tolerance, which were regulated through the p38/STAT3 pathway.}},

abstract = {{RNA sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of how the transcriptome affects disease. However, sequencing technologies often unintentionally introduce experimental error into RNA sequencing data. To counteract this, normalization methods are standardly applied with the intent of reducing the non-biologically derived variability inherent in transcriptomic measurements. However, the comparative efficacy of the various normalization techniques has not been tested in a standardized manner. Here we propose tests that evaluate numerous normalization techniques and applied them to a large-scale standard data set. These tests comprise a protocol that allows researchers to measure the amount of non-biological variability which is present in any data set after normalization has been performed, a crucial step to assessing the biological validity of data following normalization. In this study we present two tests to assess the validity of normalization methods applied to a large-scale data set collected for systematic evaluation purposes. We tested various RNASeq normalization procedures and concluded that transcripts per million (TPM) was the best performing normalization method based on its preservation of biological signal as compared to the other methods tested. Normalization is of vital importance to accurately interpret the results of genomic and transcriptomic experiments. More work, however, needs to be performed to optimize normalization methods for RNASeq data. The present effort helps pave the way for more systematic evaluations of normalization methods across different platforms. With our proposed schema researchers can evaluate their own or future normalization methods to further improve the field of RNASeq normalization.}},

Further, available drugs for influencing osteosarcoma via prognostic OSCGs were revealed. A 3-OSCG-based prognostic risk score signature was generated and by combining other clinic-pathological independent prognostic factor, stage at diagnosis, a nomogram was established to predict individual survival probability. In external independent TARGET cohort, the molecular types, the 3-gene signature as well as nomogram were validated.

In order to develop an accurate treatment for OS, a deeper understanding of its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) is required. In the present study, tissues were isolated from six patients with OS, and then subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using a 10× Genomics platform. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was subsequently used to validate the subsets identified by scRNA-seq. ScRNA-seq of six patients with OS was performed prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and data were obtained on 29,278 cells. A total of nine major cell types were identified, and the single-cell transcriptional map of OS was subsequently revealed. Identified osteoblastic OS cells were divided into five subsets, and the subsets of those osteoblastic OS cells with significant prognostic correlation were determined using a deconvolution algorithm. Thereby, different transcription patterns in the cellular subtypes of osteoblastic OS cells were reported, and key transcription factors associated with survival prognosis were identified. Furthermore, the regulation of osteolysis by osteoblastic OS cells via receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand was revealed. Furthermore, the role of osteoblastic OS cells in regulating angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor-A was revealed. C3\_TXNIP+ macrophages and C5\_IFIT1+ macrophages were found to regulate regulatory T cells and participate in CD8+ T cell exhaustion, illustrating the possibility of immunotherapy that could target CD8+ T cells and macrophages. Our findings here show that the role of C1\_osteoblastic OS cells in OS is to promote osteolysis and angiogenesis, and this is associated with survival prognosis. In addition, T cell depletion is an important feature of OS. More importantly, the present study provided a valuable resource for the in-depth study of the heterogeneity of the OS TME.}},

abstract = {{Cellular functions are strongly dependent on surrounding cells and environmental factors. Current technologies are limited in their ability to characterize the spatial location and gene programs of cells in poorly structured and dynamic niches. We developed a method, NICHE-seq, that combines photoactivatable fluorescent reporters, two-photon microscopy, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to infer the cellular and molecular composition of niches. We applied NICHE-seq to examine the high-order assembly of immune cell networks. NICHE-seq is highly reproducible in spatial tissue reconstruction, enabling identification of rare niche-specific immune subpopulations and gene programs, including natural killer cells within infected B cell follicles and distinct myeloid states in the spleen and tumor. This study establishes NICHE-seq as a broadly applicable method for elucidating high-order spatial organization of cell types and their molecular pathways.}},

abstract = {{Inflammatory response took part in the progression of tumor and was regarded as the hallmark of cancer. However, the prognostic relationship between osteosarcoma and inflammatory response-associated genes (IRGs) was unclear. This research aimed to explore the correlations between osteosarcoma prognosis and IRG signature. The inflammatory response-associated differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) were screened out through Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) databases. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were utilized to construct the IRG signature. The prognostic value of signature was investigated through Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curve and nomogram. DEmRNAs among high and low inflammatory response-associated risks were identified and functional enrichment analyses were conducted. ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment analyses (ssGSEA) were implied to reveal the alterations in immune infiltration. All the above results were validated in Target database. The expression of IRGs was also validated in different cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and osteosarcoma patient samples by immunohistochemistry. The IRG signature that consisted of two genes (MYC, CLEC5A) was established. In training and validation datasets, patients with lower risk scores survived longer and the IRG signature was confirmed as the independent prognostic factor in osteosarcoma. The nomogram was constructed and the calibration curves demonstrated the reliability of this model. Functional analysis of risk score-associated DEmRNAs indicated that immune-related pathways and functions were significantly enriched. ssGSEA revealed that 14 immune cells and 11 immune functions were significantly dysregulated. The qRT-PCR results indicated IRGs were significantly differently expressed in osteosarcoma and osteoblast cell lines. The immunohistochemistry analyses of patients’ samples revealed the same result. The novel osteosarcoma inflammatory response-associated prognostic signature was established and validated in this study. This model could serve as the biomarker and therapeutic target for osteosarcoma in the future.}},

We seek to define distinct features of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment by analyzing single cells from bone metastatic prostate tumors, involved BM, uninvolved BM, and BM from cancer-free, orthopedic patients, and healthy individuals. Metastatic PCa is associated with multifaceted immune distortion, specifically exhaustion of distinct T cell subsets, appearance of macrophages with states specific to PCa bone metastases. The chemokine CCL20 is notably overexpressed by myeloid cells, as is its cognate CCR6 receptor on T cells. Disruption of the CCL20-CCR6 axis in mice with syngeneic PCa bone metastases restores T cell reactivity and significantly prolongs animal survival. Comparative high-resolution analysis of PCa bone metastases shows a targeted approach for relieving local immunosuppression for therapeutic effect.}},

abstract = {{Cancers display significant heterogeneity with respect to tissue of origin, driver mutations, and other features of the surrounding tissue. It is likely that individual tumors engage common patterns of the immune system—here “archetypes”—creating prototypical non-destructive tumor immune microenvironments (TMEs) and modulating tumor-targeting. To discover the dominant immune system archetypes, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Immunoprofiler Initiative (IPI) processed 364 individual tumors across 12 cancer types using standardized protocols. Computational clustering of flow cytometry and transcriptomic data obtained from cell sub-compartments uncovered dominant patterns of immune composition across cancers. These archetypes were profound insofar as they also differentiated tumors based upon unique immune and tumor gene-expression patterns. They also partitioned well-established classifications of tumor biology. The IPI resource provides a template for understanding cancer immunity as a collection of dominant patterns of immune organization and provides a rational path forward to learn how to modulate these to improve therapy.}},

abstract = {{Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.}},

abstract = {{Methylation of N6 adenosine (m6A) plays important regulatory roles in diverse biological processes. The purpose of this research was to explore the potential mechanism of m6A modification level on the clinical outcome of stage III colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were adopted to reveal the signal pathway which was most likely affected by m6A methylation. The linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) method and the least absolute shrink-age and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model were used to identify the signature. The signature can sensitively separate the patients into high and low risk indicating the relapse-free survival (RFS) time based on time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Then, the multi-gene signature was validated in GSE14333 and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. The number of the samples in GSE14333 and TCGA cohort are 63 and 150. Finally, two nomograms were set up and validated to predict prognosis of patients with stage III CRC. The hematopoietic cell lineage (HCL) signaling pathway was disclosed through GSEA and GSVA. Seven HCL-related genes were determined in the LASSO model to construct signature, with AUC 0.663, 0.708, and 0.703 at 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS, respectively. Independent datasets analysis and stratification analysis indicated that the HCL-related signature was reliable in distinguishing high- and low-risk stage III CRC patients. Two nomograms incorporating the signature and pathological N stage were set up, which yielded good discrimination and calibration in the predictions of prognosis for stage III CRC patients. A novel HCL-related signature was developed as a predictive model for survival rate of stage III CRC patients. Nomograms based on the signature were advantageous to facilitate personalized counseling and treatment in stage III CRC.}},

Immune-associated genes between these groups were compared, and an optimal immune-related risk model was built by Cox regression analyses. The deconvolution algorithm (referred to as CIBERSORT) was applied to assess 22 TIICs for their amounts in the osteosarcoma microenvironment. Osteosarcoma cases with high immune score had significantly improved outcome (P<0.01). The proportions of naive B cells and M0 macrophages were significantly lower in high immune score tissues compared with the low immune score group (P<0.05), while the amounts of M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, and resting dendritic cells were significantly higher (P<0.05). Important immune-associated genes were determined to generate a prognostic model by Cox regression analysis. Interestingly, cases with high risk score had poor outcome (P<0.01). The areas under the curve (AUC) for the risk model in predicting 1, 3 and 5-year survival were 0.634, 0.781, and 0.809, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis suggested immunosuppression in high-risk osteosarcoma patients, in association with poor outcome.}},
