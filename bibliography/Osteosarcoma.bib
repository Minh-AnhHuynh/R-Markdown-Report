abstract = {{It is now well established that cancer cells co-exist within a complex environment with stromal cells and depend for their growth and dissemination on tight and plastic interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer cells incite the formation of new blood and lymphatic vessels from preexisting vessels to cope with their high nutrient/oxygen demand and favor tumor outgrowth. Research over the past decades has highlighted the crucial role played by tumor-associated blood and lymphatic vasculature in supporting immunoevasion and in subverting T-cell-mediated immunosurveillance, which are the main hallmarks of cancers. The structurally and functionally aberrant tumor vasculature contributes to the protumorigenic and immunosuppressive TME by maintaining a cancer cell’s permissive environment characterized by hypoxia, acidosis, and high interstitial pressure, while simultaneously generating a physical barrier to T cells' infiltration. Recent research moreover has shown that blood endothelial cells forming the tumor vessels can actively suppress the recruitment, adhesion, and activity of T cells. Likewise, during tumorigenesis the lymphatic vasculature undergoes dramatic remodeling that facilitates metastatic spreading of cancer cells and immunosuppression. Beyond carcinogenesis, the erratic tumor vasculature has been recently implicated in mechanisms of therapy resistance, including those limiting the efficacy of clinically approved immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint blockers and adoptive T-cell transfer. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence highlighting the major role played by tumor-associated blood and lymphatic vasculature in thwarting immunosurveillance mechanisms and antitumor immunity. Moreover, we also discuss novel therapeutic approaches targeting the tumor vasculature and their potential to help overcoming immunotherapy resistance.}},

abstract = {{Neutrophils play a key role in defence against infection and in the activation and regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. In cancer, tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs) have emerged as an important component of the tumour microenvironment. Here, they can exert dual functions. TANs can be part of tumour-promoting inflammation by driving angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, metastasis and immunosuppression. Conversely, neutrophils can also mediate antitumour responses by direct killing of tumour cells and by participating in cellular networks that mediate antitumour resistance. Neutrophil diversity and plasticity underlie the dual potential of TANs in the tumour microenvironment. Myeloid checkpoints as well as the tumour and tissue contexture shape neutrophil function in response to conventional therapies and immunotherapy. We surmise that neutrophils can provide tools to tailor current immunotherapy strategies and pave the way to myeloid cell-centred therapeutic strategies, which would be complementary to current approaches. This Review discusses the emerging dual role played by neutrophils in the tumour microenvironment as part of tumour-promoting inflammation, while also mediating antitumour immune responses, and suggests that neutrophil function could be manipulated in myeloid cell-based therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes.}},

abstract = {{Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common malignant bone tumor originating in the interstitial tissues and occurring mostly in adolescents and young adults. Energy metabolism is a prerequisite for cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. However, the gene signatures associated with energy metabolism and their underlying molecular mechanisms that drive them are unknown. Energy metabolism-related genes were obtained from the TARGET database. We applied the “NFM” algorithm to classify putative signature gene into subtypes based on energy metabolism. Key genes related to progression were identified by weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox proportional regression hazards model analyses, a gene signature for the predication of OS progression and prognosis was established. Robustness and estimation evaluations and comparison against other models were used to evaluate the prognostic performance of our model. Two subtypes associated with energy metabolism was determined using the “NFM” algorithm, and significant modules related to energy metabolism were identified by WGCNA. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) suggested that the genes in the significant modules were enriched in kinase, immune metabolism processes, and metabolism-related pathways. We constructed a seven-gene signature consisting of SLC18B1, RBMXL1, DOK3, HS3ST2, ATP6V0D1, CCAR1, and C1QTNF1 to be used for OS progression and prognosis. Upregulation of CCAR1, and C1QTNF1 was associated with augmented OS risk, whereas, increases in the expression SCL18B1, RBMXL1, DOK3, HS3ST2, and ATP6VOD1 was correlated with a diminished risk of OS. We confirmed that the seven-gene signature was robust, and was superior to the earlier models evaluated; therefore, it may be used for timely OS diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The seven-gene signature related to OS energy metabolism developed here could be used in the early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of OS.}},

Gene expression profiles and clinical data of osteosarcoma patients were downloaded from the TARGET dataset. ESTIMATE algorithm was used to quantify the immune score. Then, the association between immune score and prognosis was studied. Afterward, a differential analysis was performed based on the high- and low-immune scores to determine TME-related genes. Additionally, Cox analyses were performed to construct two prognostic signatures for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), respectively. Two datasets obtained from the GEO database were used to validate signatures. Eighty-five patients were included in our research. The survival analysis indicated that patients with higher immune score have a favorable OS and DFS. Moreover, 769 genes were determined as TME-related genes. The unsupervised clustering analysis revealed two clusters were significantly related to immune score and T cells CD4 memory fraction. In addition, two signatures were generated based on three and two TME-related genes, respectively. Both two signatures can significantly divide patients into low- and high-risk groups and were validated in two GEO datasets. Afterward, the risk score and metastatic status were identified as independent prognostic factors for both OS and DFS and two nomograms were generated. The C-indexes of OS nomogram and DFS nomogram were 0.791 and 0.711, respectively. TME was associated with the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. Prognostic models based on TME-related genes can effectively predict OS and DFS of osteosarcoma patients.}},

Frequency, incidence, and survival rates for 3482 patients with osteosarcoma from the National Cancer Institute's population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program between 1973 and 2004 were investigated by age (ages 0-24 years, 25-59 years, and 60 to ≥85 years), race, sex, pathology subtype, stage, and anatomic site. There were large differences in incidence and survival rates by age. There was a high percentage of osteosarcoma with Paget disease and osteosarcoma as a second or later cancer among the elderly. There was a high percentage of osteosarcoma among patients with Paget disease and osteosarcoma as a second or later cancer among the elderly. Tumor site differences among age groups were noted. Survival rates varied by anatomic site and disease stage and did not improve significantly from 1984 to 2004. This comprehensive, population-based description of osteosarcoma, identified important differences in incidence, survival, pathologic subtype, and anatomic site among age groups, and quantified the impact of osteosarcoma in patients with Paget disease or as a second cancer on incidence and mortality rates.

Accordingly, following TGF-β blockade, depletion of these neutrophils significantly blunts antitumor effects of treatment and reduces CD8+ T cell activation. In contrast, in control tumors, neutrophil depletion decreases tumor growth and results in more activated CD8+ T cells intratumorally. Together, these data suggest that TGF-β within the tumor microenvironment induces a population of TAN with a protumor phenotype. TGF-β blockade results in the recruitment and activation of TANs with an antitumor phenotype.}},

Neutrophils are professional phagocytes that constitute the first line of defense in humans.

Recent advances in intravital microscopic technologies using animal model systems have enabled researchers to directly visualize neutrophil trafficking. Consequently, the specific mechanisms of neutrophil transmigration have been identified, and even the reverse migration of neutrophils can be verified visually. Moreover, the detailed phenomena of neutrophil infiltration into various organs, such as the liver, lymphoid organs, and CNS have been identified. This progress in the study of neutrophil migration from the blood vessels to organs results in a deeper understanding of these immune cells’ motility and morphology, which are closely related to the spatiotemporal regulation of the overall immune response.

Latest evidences of neutrophil functional diversity in tumor raised many questions and suggest that targeting these cells can offer new treatment opportunities in the context of ICI development. Here, we summarized key information on TAN origin, function, and plasticity that should be considered when developing ICIs and provide a detailed review of the ongoing clinical trials that combine ICIs and a second compound that might affect or be affected by TANs. This review article synthetizes important notions from the literature demonstrating that: (1) Cancer development associates with a profound alteration of neutrophil biogenesis and function that can predict and interfere with the response to ICIs, (2) Neutrophil infiltration in tumor is associated with key features of resistance to ICIs, and (3) TANs play an important role in resistance to antiangiogenic drugs reducing their clinical benefit when used in combination with ICIs. Finally, exploring the clinical/translational aspects of neutrophil impact on the response to ICIs offers the opportunity to propose new translational research avenues to better understand TAN biology and treat patients.}},

Therefore, fresh porcine whole blood was compared to whole blood stored for 24 h in the dark at room temperature. Different cell parameters in whole blood and in isolated neutrophils were analyzed. The following parameters were analyzed: cell count, band and segmented neutrophil count, viability, cholesterol content, release of free DNA as a marker for cell death, phagocytic activity in whole blood and in isolated neutrophils, the transmigration rate of neutrophils to IL8 stimulus, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the formation of NETs. It was observed that the number of isolated neutrophils decreased over time, indicating cell death occurs during 24 h of blood storage. However, the surviving neutrophils isolated from stored blood reacted comparably or even showed enhanced antimicrobial activity in the case of phagocytosis of Streptococcus (S.) suis, ROS production, and transmigration. The slightly altered cholesterol level of the harvested neutrophils in stored blood when compared to fresh blood partially explains some of the detected differences.}},

We analyzed three different cell populations from human bone marrow, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMNs) from peripheral blood, and extravasated PMNs from skin windows using the Affymetrix 2.0 platform. Our data reveal 135 miRNAs differentially regulated during bone marrow granulopoiesis. The majority is differentially regulated between the myeloblast/promyelocyte (MB/PM) and myelocyte/metamyelocyte (MC/MM) stages of development. These 135 miRNAs were divided into six clusters according to the pattern of their expression. Several miRNAs demonstrate a pronounced increase or reduction at the transition between MB/PM and MC/MM, which is associated with cell cycle arrest and the initiation of terminal differentiation. Seven miRNAs are differentially up-regulated between peripheral blood PMNs and extravasated PMNs and only one of these (miR-132) is also differentially regulated during granulopoiesis. The study indicates that several different miRNAs participate in the regulation of normal granulopoiesis and that miRNAs might also regulate activities of extravasated neutrophils. The data present the miRNA profiles during the development and activation of the neutrophil granulocyte in healthy humans and thus serves as a reference for further research of normal and malignant granulocytic development.}},

The formation of NETs, as well as relevant regulatory mechanisms, physiological factors, and pharmacological agents have not been systematically discussed in the context of their beneficial and pathological aspects. Novel forms of NET formation including vital NET formation continue to be uncovered, however, there remain fundamental questions around established mechanisms such as NADPH-oxidase (Nox)-dependent and Nox-independent NET formation. Whether NET formation takes place in the tissue versus the bloodstream, internal factors (e.g. reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and transcription factor activation), and external factors (e.g. alkaline pH and hypertonic conditions), have all been demonstrated to influence specific NET pathways. Elements of neutrophil biology such as transcription and mitochondria, which were previously of unknown significance, have been identified as critical mediators of NET formation through facilitating chromatin decondensation and generating ROS, respectively. While promising therapeutics inhibiting ROS, transcription, and gasdermin D are being investigated, neutrophil phagocytosis plays a critical role in host defense and any therapies targeting NET formation must avoid impairing the physiological functions of these cells. This review summarizes what is known in the many domains of NET research, highlights the most relevant challenges in the field, and inspires new questions that can bring us closer to a unified model of NET formation.}},

A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95\% Confidence Interval (95\%CI). A total of 38 articles, including 5699 patients with severity outcomes and 6033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95\%CI 0.72–1.04; I2 = 75.52\% and 1.87; 95\%CI 1.25–2.49; I2 = 97.81\%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.74 (95\%CI 0.98–7.66). High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.}},

Supplemented with original data, we test the hypothesis that buoyant density of neutrophils is characterized by a spectrum that as a whole shifts to a lower density after activation. Both the 20\% highest density (HDNs) and 20\% lowest density (LDNs) neutrophils from healthy donors were isolated by Percoll of different densities. Using this method we found that LDNs were significantly better in T‐cell suppression and bacterial containment than their 20\% highest density counterparts. We found no statistically relevant differences in neutrophil survival or bacterial phagocytosis. Stimulation of healthy donor neutrophils with N‐formyl‐methionyl‐leucyl‐phenylalanine induced LDNs co‐segregating with peripheral blood mononuclear cells after Ficoll separation. These in vitro induced LDNs showed increased activation markers compared to HDNs and were comparable to the activation markers found on the LDN fraction seen in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions such as present in cancer patients. This all fits with the hypothesis that the density of neutrophils is distributed in a spectrum partially coupled to maturation. Additionally a shift in this spectrum can be induced by in vitro stimulation or by activation in disease.}},

During their lifecycle, neutrophils mainly evolve under low oxygen conditions (0.1–4\% O2), to which they are well adapted. Neutrophils are atypical cells since they are highly glycolytic and susceptible to oxygen exposure, which induces their activation and death through mechanisms that remain currently elusive. Nevertheless, nearly all studies conducted on neutrophils are carried out under atmospheric oxygen (21\%), corresponding to hyperoxia. Here, we investigated the impact of hyperoxia during neutrophil purification and culture on neutrophil viability, activation and cytosolic protein content. We demonstrate that neutrophil hyper‐activation (CD62L shedding) is induced during culture under hyperoxic conditions (24 h), compared with neutrophils cultured under anoxic conditions. Spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is observed when neutrophils face hyperoxia during purification or culture. In addition, we show that maintaining neutrophils in autologous plasma is the preferred strategy to maintain their basal state. Our results show that manipulating neutrophils under hyperoxic conditions leads to the loss of 57 cytosolic proteins during purification, while it does not lead to an immediate impact on neutrophil activation (CD11bhigh, CD54high, CD62Lneg) or viability (DAPI+). We identified two clusters of proteins belonging to cholesterol metabolism and to the complement and coagulation cascade pathways, which are highly susceptible to neutrophil oxygen exposure during neutrophil purification. In conclusion, protecting neutrophil from oxygen during their purification and culture is recommended to avoid activation and to prevent the alteration of cytosolic protein composition.}},

From their initial appearance in the liver, thymus, and spleen at around the eighth week of human gestation to their generation in large numbers in the bone marrow at the end of term gestation, the differentiation of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell into a mature, segmented neutrophil is a highly controlled process where the transcriptional regulators C/EBP-α and C/EBP-ε play a vital role. Recent advances in neutrophil biology have clarified the life cycle of these cells and revealed striking differences between neonatal and adult neutrophils based on fetal maturation and environmental factors. Here we detail neutrophil ontogeny, granulopoiesis, and neutrophil homeostasis and highlight important differences between neonatal and adult neutrophil populations.}},

Although a well-described phenomenon, research to date has only analyzed blood samples acquired post-hospital admission, and the mechanisms that initiate compromised neutrophil function post-injury are therefore poorly understood. Here, we analyzed pre-hospital blood samples acquired from 62 adult trauma patients (mean age 44 years, range 19–95 years) within 1 h of injury (mean time to sample 39 min, range 13–59 min). We found an immediate impairment in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) generation in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, which persisted into the acute post-injury phase (4–72 h). Reduced NET generation was accompanied by reduced reactive oxygen species production, impaired activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and a reduction in neutrophil glucose uptake and metabolism to lactate. Pre-treating neutrophils from healthy subjects with mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), whose circulating levels were significantly increased in our trauma patients, reduced NET generation. This mtDAMP-induced impairment in NET formation was associated with an N-formyl peptide mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a negative regulator of aerobic glycolysis and NET formation. Indeed, activation of AMPK via treatment with the AMP-mimetic AICAR significantly reduced neutrophil lactate production in response to PMA stimulation, a phenomenon that we also observed for neutrophils pre-treated with mtDAMPs. Furthermore, the impairment in NET generation induced by mtDAMPs was partially ameliorated by pre-treating neutrophils with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Taken together, our data demonstrate an immediate trauma-induced impairment in neutrophil anti-microbial function and identify mtDAMP release as a potential initiator of acute post-injury neutrophil dysfunction.}},

However, the relevance of TAN in breast cancer has not been previously investigated and here we sought to determine their presence among different subtypes. We analyzed patients with stage I-III breast cancers between 2006 and 2012. Tumors were divided into three subtypes: hormone-receptor [HR]-positive, HER2-negative (HR+, HER2-ve); HER2-positive and triple negative (TN). Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were examined and the number of TAN per 10 high power fields (HPF, 40x) was recorded. Tumors with >1 TAN per 10 HPF were considered TAN-positive. Fisher’s exact test was used to test for independence between qualitative variables, and logistic regression models were applied for multivariate analysis. A total of 133 patients were assessed for inclusion and 105 were analyzed (28 excluded on various criteria). Some 72 tumors (69\%) were classified as HR+, HER2-ve, 15 (14\%) as HER2+ and 18 (17\%) as TN. Totals of 16 TN (88\%), 8 HER2+ (53\%) and 4 HR+, HER2-ve tumors (5\%) were TAN+ (p<0.001), including 79\% of HR-ve tumors (19 of 24), in contrast to 11\% of their HR+ve counterparts (9 of 81) (p<0.001). HER2 expression (p=0.023) and tumor grade (p<0.001) were also associated with TAN positivity. On multivariate analysis, only HR negativity (OR 16.85; 95\% CI 4.4-64.6, p=<0.0001) was associated with a higher likelihood of TAN positivity. TAN are present in most TN tumors. We found an absence of HR expression to be the only predictor of TAN positivity. These results raise the question as to whether TAN, as part of the tumor microenvironment, have a role in the aggressiveness and progression of TN tumors and thus warrant further investigation in this breast cancer subtype, particularly in relation to response to treatment and prognosis.}},

Although neutrophils are traditionally considered in the context of their antibacterial functions, it is becoming increasingly clear that tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) play a major role in cancer biology. Neutrophils make up a significant portion of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in many models of cancer. Like all other leukocytes, they move into tissues under the influence of specific chemokines, cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. The tumor microenvironment has been shown to be responsible for their recruitment in cancer. We have found that TAN are a distinct population of neutrophils, differing markedly in their transcriptomic profile from both naive neutrophils and the granulocytic fraction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Studies have demonstrated specific examples of tumor-mediated signals (such as transforming growth factor-β) that induce the formation of a pro-tumorigenic (N2) phenotype capable of supporting tumor growth and suppressing the antitumor immune response. However, there are also studies showing that TAN can also have an antitumorigenic (N1) phenotype. Herein, we explore the literature on the different mechanisms of TAN recruitment to tumors, the unique characteristics of TAN and what shapes their pro- and/or antitumor effects.}},

Neutrophils accumulate in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer, especially in those with advanced-stage disease, and a high circulating neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a robust biomarker of poor clinical outcome in various cancers. To date, most studies investigating the role of neutrophils in cancer have involved animal models or investigated the function of circulating human neutrophils. Thus, only limited information is available on the roles of intratumoural neutrophils (also known as tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs)) in patients with cancer. In this Review, we initially describe the evidence correlating the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with prognosis, followed by a discussion on the predictive value of TANs, which remains debatable, with conflicting data from different cancer types, including variations based on neutrophil location within and/or around the tumour. We then explore available data on the implications of TAN phenotypes and functions for cancer development and progression, highlighting the reported effects of various treatments on TANs and how neutrophils might affect therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we examine the various compounds capable of modulating neutrophils and suggest future research directions that might ultimately enable the manipulation of TANs in patients with cancer. Neutrophils accumulate in the circulation of patients with cancer, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a widely used biomarker. However, the effects of neutrophils on tumour development and progression, and the efficacy of therapies, remain relatively unknown. In this Review, the authors draw on data from animal models and patients with cancer to provide an overview of the effects of neutrophils in cancer. The traditionally held belief that neutrophils are merely a bystander in the tumour microenvironment has been revolutionized over the past decade, and research has now established that neutrophils have an important contribution in the initiation, development and progression of cancer.Tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs) predict poor overall survival in many types of cancer, with their location in the tumour and specific markers being important deferential determinants.Data on the phenotype and function of TANs in patients with cancer remain limited and are mostly from those with early stage disease.Both antitumour and protumour functions of TANs have been described in patients with cancer, with both direct and indirect effects on tumour cells as well as indirect effects on the tumour microenvironment and its immune content.The importance of neutrophils in mediating the effects of existing and established cancer therapies is an emerging and exciting area of research.The ability to target TANs clinically, either by suppression or phenotypic manipulation, might be an important outcome of research into the role of TANs in cancer and could enable the development of a new generation of immunotherapies.

Furthermore, we explored the therapeutic merit of targeting Notch signalling in EOC and determined its involvement in the immune microenvironment. High level of TANs is associated with a dismal prognosis and immune tolerance in EOC. TANs impaired cytotoxic effects of CD8+ T cells partly through Jagged2 (JAG2). Notch pathway blocked using γ-secretase inhibitor LY3039478 and anti-JAG2 antibody led to retarded tumour growth and augmented cytotoxic effects of CD8+ T cells. IL-8 contributes to the recruitment of TANs and the induction of JAG2 expression in TANs. Blockade of CXCR2 signalling reduces tumour growth rate, accompanied by a decreasing amount of TANs and increasing activity of CD8+ T cells. JAG2+TANs is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes. JAG2+TANs are closely linked to IL-8-driven immune evasion microenvironment and may serve as a promising therapeutic target for the reinvigoration of anti-tumour immunity.}},

Neutrophils constitute an important portion of the infiltrating immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, but controversy has long surrounded the function of these cells in the context of cancer. Multiple evidences have shown that neutrophils recruited to the tumor can acquire either protumor or antitumor function. These findings have led to the identification of multiple and heterogeneous neutrophil subsets in the tumor and circulation. In addition, tumor‐associated neutrophils (TANs) were shown to demonstrate functional plasticity, driven by multiple factors present in the tumor microenvironment.

We then discuss the pro vs antitumor nature of TANs in cancer, their functional plasticity and the mechanisms that regulate neutrophil recruitment and polarization. Although the vast majority of the knowledge on neutrophils in cancer comes from murine studies, recent work has been done on human cancer‐related neutrophils. In the final paragraphs, we expand on the current knowledge regarding the role of neutrophils in human cancer and examine the question whether cancer‐related neutrophils (circulating or intratumoral) could be a new possible target for cancer immunotherapy. Neutrophils constitute an important portion of the immune infiltrate in many tumors and play a major role in cancer biology. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the different neutrophil subsets identified in the context of cancer so far, and comprehends the relationships between them. The mechanisms regulating the recruitment, polarization, and function of cancer‐related neutrophils are further discussed.}},

abstract = {{Neutrophils are the main leukocyte subset present in human blood and play a fundamental role in the defense against infections. Neutrophils are also an important component of the tumor stroma because they are recruited by selected chemokines produced by both cancer cells and other cells of the stroma. Even if their presence has been mostly associated with a bad prognosis, tumor-associated neutrophils are present in different maturation and activation states and can exert both protumor and antitumor activities. In addition, it is now emerging that chemokines not only induce neutrophil directional migration but also have an important role in their activation and maturation. For these reasons, chemokines and chemokine receptors are now considered targets to improve the antitumoral function of neutrophils in cancer immunotherapy. Neutrophils are an important component of the tumor microenvironment, and their infiltration has been associated with a poor prognosis for most human tumors. However, neutrophils have been shown to be endowed with both protumor and antitumor activities, reflecting their heterogeneity and plasticity in cancer. A growing body of studies has demonstrated that chemokines and chemokine receptors, which are fundamental regulators of neutrophils trafficking, can affect neutrophil maturation and effector functions. Here, we review human and mouse data suggesting that targeting chemokines or chemokine receptors can modulate neutrophil activity and improve their antitumor properties and the efficiency of immunotherapy.}},

By longitudinally quantifying the infiltration and persistence of TAN into growing tumors in the same animals, we observed cells that either populated the peripheral stromal zone of the tumor (peritumoral TAN) or infiltrated into the tumor core (intratumoral TAN). Intratumoral TAN showed prolonged tumor-associated persistence and reduced motility compared to peritumoral TAN, whose velocity increased with tumor progression. Selective pharmacological blockade of CXCR2 receptors using AZD5069 profoundly inhibited recruitment of TAN into peritumoral regions, while intratumoral infiltration was only transiently attenuated and rebounded at later time points. Our findings unravel distinct spatial dynamics of TAN that are partially and differentially regulated via the CXCR2 signaling pathway.}},

IRB approval was obtained and two pathologists, blinded to stage/outcome, counted TAN in 20 high power fields (HPF) per specimen. TAN score was defined as the mean of these counts. High TAN was defined as at or greater than the median score for that stage. Demographics, tumor characteristics, and overall survival (OS) were obtained from the records and examined for association with TAN score. IHC for arginase expression was performed in a subset of samples. 221 patients were included. Stage II patients with high TAN scores had an OS of 232 months as compared to those with low TAN (OS = 85 months, p = 0.03). The survival benefit persisted in multivariable analysis (HR 0.48, CI 0.25–0.91, p = 0.026) controlling for age and sex. Women had increased survival as compared to men, and there were no significant prognostic associations with TAN count in stage III/IV patients, although there were only 12 stage IV patients. Arginase staining did not provide additional information. Stage II colorectal cancer patients with high TAN live nearly 3 times longer than those with low TAN. Women with stage II disease and high TAN counts appear to be driving the survival benefit seen in the stage II patients and have increased overall survival in all stages.}},

A new neutrophil mechanism was discovered recently, i.e., the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These structures, composed of DNA strands and neutrophil granule proteins, are an element of the non-specific immune response and bind pathogens to prevent their spread and ensure increased local concentrations of toxic factors. Research on this phenomenon shows that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) also form and release NETs. Reports on the role of NETs in the course of cancer are scarce, and the opinions on the involvement of extracellular traps in the disease are divided, indicating a dual function. There is speculation about the anti-cancer properties of NETs connected with direct killing of cancer cells or stimulation of the immune system. On the other hand, the trap structures might promote migration and immune escape of cancer cells or constitute a physical barrier between cancer cells and immune-competent cells. This article summarizes our knowledge about the proven roles of NETs in the course of cancer with particular focus on the significance of NETs as prognosis biomarkers in the course of the neoplastic process and their potential use in therapy.}},

Several studies have demonstrated the cytotoxic capacity of neutrophils against different types of tumors, by releasing inflammatory cytokines, ROS and activating other immune cells. On the other hand, recent papers have claimed the protumorigenic action of neutrophils, mainly by changing their phenotype and producing cytokines that promote tumor growth. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate neutrophil action and function during tumor development. To do so, we used male Wistar rats inoculated with Walker 256 breast carcinoma. Tumor, circulating neutrophils and bone marrow were studied in the following time points after tumor inoculation: 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 3 d, 5 d, 7 d, 10 d, and 14 d, in order to analyze neutrophil migration kinetics, circulating neutrophil phenotype and bone marrow response to the tumor growth. Herein, our results demonstrated that W256T was unable to trigger an intratumoral inflammatory response after 5 days of tumor development and consequently, from that point on, prevented neutrophil migration to its microenvironment. Also, the tumor changed circulating neutrophil phenotype by up-regulating inflammation-related genes. Even though circulating neutrophils were entirely able to respond to an inflammatory stimulus, they did not recognize and attack the tumor, allowing the tumor to grow without any immune interference. To promote the entry of neutrophils into the tumor microenvironment, LPS was injected intratumorally. Neutrophil migration and activation due to LPS injection resulted in complete tumor regression in all subjects. In conclusion, activating neutrophils, within the tumor, turned the carcinoma into a recognizable immune target and eliminated it.}},

A total of 204 meta-analyses from 86 studies investigating the association between either NLR or TAN and cancer outcomes met the criteria for inclusion. All but one meta-analyses found a hazard ratio (HR) which increased risk (HR > 1). We did not find sufficient meta-analyses to evaluate TAN and cancer outcomes (N = 9). When assessed for magnitude of effect, significance and bias related to heterogeneity and small study effects, 18 (9\%) associations between NLR and outcomes in composite cancer endpoints (combined analysis), cancers treated with immunotherapy and some site specific cancers (urinary, nasopharyngeal, gastric, breast, endometrial, soft tissue sarcoma and hepatocellular cancers) were supported by strong evidence.

Their diversity and plasticity are being increasingly recognized. This review summarizes previous studies assessing the roles and mechanisms of neutrophils in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis and relapse. Although the findings are controversial, the fact that neutrophils play a dual role in promoting and suppressing cancer is undeniable. The plasticity of neutrophils allows them to adapt to different cancer microenvironments and exert different effects on cancer. Given the findings from our own research, we propose a reasonable hypothesis that neutrophils may be reprogrammed into a cancer-promoting state in the cancer microenvironment.

In the current review, we describe what is known in general about the role of neutrophils in cancer. What is emerging is a complex, rather heterogeneous picture with both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles, which apparently differs with cancer type and disease stage. Furthermore, we will discuss the well-known role of neutrophils as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and also on the role of neutrophils as important effector cells during antibody therapy in cancer.

While in many cases neutrophils have been shown to promote tumor progression, for instance by acting as MDSC, there are also protective effects, particularly when antibody immunotherapy is performed. A better understanding of the role of neutrophils is likely to provide opportunities for immunomodulation and for improving the treatment of cancer patients.}},

The Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is an inflammation-based prognostic factor for gastric cancer. This study aimed to investigate the distribution of CD15+neutrophils in the primary tumor and Tumor-Draining Lymph Nodes (TDLNs), and to examine the association of TANs with the clinicopathological features (including NLR) of patients with gastric cancer. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the median number of CD15+TANs was 18 and 24 per high-power field (HPF) in primary tumors and TDLNs, respectively. Patients were divided into high and low infiltration groups based on the median number. A high number of infiltrating CD15+TANs in the primary tumors and in the TDLNs were associated with depth of invasion and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that a poor overall survival was associated with high numbers of CD15+TANs, and the multivariate analyses revealed that a high number of CD15+TANs in the TDLNs was an independent prognostic factor. The numbers of CD15+TANs in the primary tumors and TDLNs showed weak positive correlation. The number of CD15+TANs in the primary tumors was positively correlated with the preoperative NLR, (P = 0.001, R = 0.327) and immunohistochemical staining revealed that C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) +neutrophils might be the origin of the CD15+TANs. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that infiltrating neutrophils increased in the tumor and TDLN compared to non-cancerous tissue. Neutrophils treated with cancer supernatant upregulated TWIST and IL-6 genes in vitro. Our findings suggested that local infiltration of CD15+TANs may be correlated with inflammation in TDLNs and systemic response to cause metastasis in gastric carcinoma.}},

Through the generation of reactive oxidants, activation of granular constituents and neutrophil extracellular traps, neutrophils target microbes and prevent their dissemination. While these pathways are beneficial in the context of trauma and infection, their off-target effects in the context of tumor are variable. Tumor-derived factors have been shown to reprogram the marrow, skewing toward the expansion of myelopoiesis. This can result in stimulation of both neutrophilic leukocytosis and the release of immature granulocytic populations that accumulate in circulation and in the tumor microenvironment. While activated neutrophils have been shown to kill tumor cells, there is growing evidence for neutrophil activation driving tumor progression and metastasis through a number of pathways, including stimulation of thrombosis and angiogenesis, stromal remodeling, and impairment of T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. There is also growing appreciation of neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, with distinct neutrophil populations promoting cancer control or progression. In addition to the effects of tumor on neutrophil responses, anti-neoplastic treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and growth factors, can influence neutrophil responses. Future directions for research are expected to result in more mechanistic knowledge of neutrophil biology in the tumor microenvironment that may be exploited as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.}},

In recent times, most studies have analysed the role that tumour‐associated macrophages (TAM) have on tumour progression. However, there is now increasing evidence to show that neutrophils also actively participate in this process. Whilst there are some data to suggest that neutrophil‐derived factors can promote genetic mutations leading to tumourigenesis, or secrete factors that promote tumour cell proliferation; there is now substantial evidence to show that neutrophils, like TAM, significantly affect tumour angiogenesis. In this review, we discuss the likely mechanisms by which neutrophils are recruited into the tumour and then elaborate on how these cells may induce tumour vascularization by the secretion of powerful pro‐angiogenic factors. We also discuss possible future chemotherapeutic strategies that are aimed at limiting tumour angiogenesis by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment.}},

Neutrophils are receiving increasing attention in the context of cancer, where these same neutrophil-associated functions are also important for modulating tumor growth and metastatic progression. Neutrophils are phenotypically heterogeneous and, depending on the context, exert anti- or pro-tumorigenic functions. Increasing evidence also suggests an important role of neutrophils and their involvement in promoting multiple steps of the metastatic cascade. The steps include: (1) local invasion and intravasation of cancer cells into circulation, (2) survival of cancer cells in the bloodstream and extravasation at a distant site, (3) early cancer cell seeding/survival, and (4) progressive growth of cancer cells to form macroscopic metastases. Although neutrophil functions designed to eliminate infectious agents can also eliminate tumor cells, their dysregulation can promote tumor growth and enable metastasis at multiple steps along the metastatic cascade.

The significance of tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) in colorectal cancer (CRC) has been the subject of conflicting reports and the present study was designed to set up a reliable methodology to assess TAN infiltration in CRC and to evaluate their clinical significance. CD66b and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were assessed as candidate neutrophil markers in CRC using immunohistochemistry. CD66b was found to be a reliable marker to identify TAN in CRC tissues, whereas MPO also identified a subset of CD68+ macrophages. CRC patients (n = 271) (Stages I–IV) were investigated retrospectively by computer-assisted imaging on whole tumor sections. TAN density dramatically decreases in Stage IV patients as compared to Stage I–III. At Cox analysis, higher TAN density was associated with better prognosis. Importantly, multivariate analysis showed that prognostic significance of TAN can be influenced by clinical stage and 5-fluorouracil(5-FU)-based chemotherapy. On separate analysis of Stage III patients (n = 178), TAN density had a dual clinical significance depending on the use of 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, higher TAN density was associated with better response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Thus, TAN are an important component of the immune cell infiltrate in CRC and assessment of TAN infiltration may help identify patients likely to benefit from 5-FU-based chemotherapy. These results call for a reassessment of the role of neutrophils in cancer using rigorous quantitative methodology.}},

Evidence shows the functional plasticity of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment, allowing neutrophils to exert either pro-tumor or anti-tumor effects.

We will discuss potential approaches to therapeutically target neutrophils in cancer.

Methods A systematic literature search through April 2016 was performed to evaluate the association between pretreatment blood NLR and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced tumors. Data were extracted from studies reporting hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) and pooled using the Mantel–Haenszel random-effect model. Results Sixty-six studies with a total of 24536 individuals were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analyses revealed that elevated pretreatment NLR was associated with worse OS (HR 1.70, 95\% CI 1.57–1.84, P <0.001) and PFS (HR 1.61, 95\% CI 1.42–1.82, P <0.001) in advanced tumors. Subgroup analysis stratified by tumor type demonstrated that pancreatic cancer patients with high pretreatment NLR had the worst OS (HR 1.94, 95\% CI 1.55–2.54, P <0.001) and colorectal cancer with the worst PFS (HR 1.74, 95\% CI 1.04–2.90, P <0.001). When stratified by cut-off value for NLR, we found that cut-off value being five indicated the worst PFS (HR 2.23, 95\% CI 1.54–3.23, P =0.019). Conclusions Overall, high pretreatment blood NLR could be an adverse prognostic indicator for advanced tumor.

In this setting, established tumors have a propensity to induce myelopoiesis and to recruit neutrophils to the tumor microenvironment (TME), where these cells undergo reprogramming and transitioning to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. In the TME, these MDSCs, via the production of a broad range of mediators, not only attenuate the anti-tumor activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, but also exclude these cells from the TME. Realization of the pro-tumorigenic activities of MDSCs of neutrophilic origin has resulted in the development of a range of adjunctive strategies targeting the recruitment of these cells and/or the harmful activities of their mediators of immunosuppression. Most of these are in the pre-clinical or very early clinical stages of evaluation. Notable exceptions, however, are several pharmacologic, allosteric inhibitors of neutrophil/MDSC CXCR1/2 receptors. These agents have entered late-stage clinical assessment as adjuncts to either chemotherapy or inhibitory immune checkpoint-targeted therapy in patients with various types of advanced malignancy. The current review updates the origins and identities of MDSCs of neutrophilic origin and their spectrum of immunosuppressive mediators, as well as current and pipeline MDSC-targeted strategies as potential adjuncts to cancer therapies.

The effects of the purified LDN on T cell proliferation and tumor cell lysis were examined in vitro. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) production was examined by extracellular nuclear staining. Results The number of LDN with an immature phenotype is markedly increased in peripheral blood samples in patients after abdominal surgery. The frequency of LDN correlated positively with operative time and intraoperative blood loss. The purified LDN significantly suppressed the proliferation of autologous T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb coated on plate and partially inhibited the cytotoxicity of lymphocytes activated with recombinant interleukin-2 against a human gastric cancer cell, OCUM-1. The LDN also produced NETs after short-term culture in vitro, which efficiently trap many OCUM-1.

We investigated clinical relevance, phenotypes, and functional features of colorectal cancer–infiltrating CD66b+ neutrophils and their crosstalk with CD8+ T cells.Experimental Design: CD66b+ and CD8+ cell infiltration was analyzed by IHC on a tissue microarray including >650 evaluable colorectal cancer samples. Phenotypic profiles of tissue-infiltrating and peripheral blood CD66b+ cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. CD66b+/CD8+ cells crosstalk was investigated by in vitro experiments.Results: CD66b+ cell infiltration in colorectal cancer is significantly associated with increased survival. Interestingly, neutrophils frequently colocalize with CD8+ T cells in colorectal cancer. Functional studies indicate that although neutrophils are devoid of direct antitumor potential, coculture with peripheral blood or tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) enhances CD8+ T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine release induced by suboptimal concentrations of anti-CD3 mAb. Moreover, under optimal activation conditions, CD8+ cell stimulation in the presence of CD66b+ cells results in increasing numbers of cells expressing CD45RO/CD62L “central memory” phenotype. Importantly, combined tumor infiltration by CD66b+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes is associated with significantly better prognosis, as compared with CD8+ T-cell infiltration alone.}},

abstract = {{Neutrophils sense and migrate towards chemotactic factors released at sites of infection/inflammation and contain the affected area using a variety of effector mechanisms. Aside from these established immune defense functions, neutrophils are emerging as one of the key tumor-infiltrating immune cells that influence cancer progression and metastasis. Neutrophil recruitment to the tumor microenvironment (TME) is mediated by multiple mediators including cytokines, chemokines, lipids, and growth factors that are secreted from cancer cells and cancer-associated stromal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the expression and secretion of the different mediators from cancer cells and how neutrophils integrate these signals to reach and invade tumors remain unclear. Here, we discuss the possible role of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, which is a well-established promoter of malignant potential in cancer, in regulating the expression and secretion of these key mediators. We also summarize and review our current understanding of the machineries that potentially control the secretion of the mediators from cancer cells, including the exocytic trafficking pathways, secretory autophagy, and extracellular vesicle-mediated secretion. We further reflect on possible mechanisms by which different mediators collaborate by integrating their signaling network, and particularly focus on TGF-β, a cytokine that is highly expressed in invasive tumors, and CXCR2 ligands, which are crucial neutrophil recruiting chemokines. Finally, we highlight gaps in the field and the need to expand current knowledge of the secretory machineries and cross-talks among mediators to develop novel neutrophil targeting strategies as effective therapeutic options in the treatment of cancer.}},

abstract = {{Metastasis is a multistep process requiring tumor cell detachment from the primary tumor and migration to target organs through the lymphatic or blood circulatory systems. Specific organs are predisposed to metastases in certain cancers and the formation of supportive metastatic microenvironment determines tumor cell homing. Such an environment is provided by a pre-metastatic niche that is formed through the recruitment of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, however the mechanisms of its formation are not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests that the primary tumor itself modulates the environment of secondary organs prior to tumor cell dissemination. The contribution of neutrophils to the formation of the pre-metastatic niche is getting growing attention. Obviously, neutrophils can affect the development of metastasis in two contradicting ways, by either stimulation or inhibition of this process, depending on the activation status. Pro-tumor neutrophils actively support metastasis formation by different mechanisms, including the formation of pre-metastatic niche, tumor cell attraction, and the direct support of tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, suppressive neutrophils, which are the granulocytic arm of MDSC, promote tumor progression by dampening anti-tumor T cell immunity. On the other hand, anti-tumor neutrophils can inhibit metastasis formation by the cytotoxicity towards tumor cells in the circulation or at the pre-metastatic site, and even via stimulation of T cell proliferation. Apparently, the regulation of the pro- or anti-tumor neutrophil properties has significant implications on metastatic spread in the host. Here we provide an up to date overview of the different roles neutrophils play in regulating the metastatic processes.}},

N2 TANs stimulate immunosuppression, tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis by DNA instability, or by cytokines and chemokines release. In tumor patients, either a high number of TANs and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) do correlate with poor prognosis, and, so far, TAN counts and NLR can be regarded as biomarkers. Owing to the pivotal role of TANs in stimulating tumor progression, therapeutic strategies to target TANs have been suggested, and two major approaches have been proposed: (a) targeting the CXCL-8/CXCR-1/CXCR-2 axis, thereby blocking TANs or (b) targeting substances produced by polymorpho-nuclear cells that promote tumor growth. Many studies have been accomplished either in vitro and in animal models, whereas clinical studies are restrained, presently, due to the risk of inducing immunosuppression. In this review, we deeply discuss the anti-tumorigenic or pro-tumorigenic activity of TANs. In particular, TANs relevance in tumor prognosis and in vitro therapeutic strategies are widely described. On-going clinical trials, aimed to inhibit neutrophil recruitment into the tumor are also accurately debated.}},

The relevance, derivation, phenotype and interactions of nodal TANs were explored via a large immunohistochemical analysis of carcinoma‐draining lymph nodes, and their clinical significance was evaluated on a retrospective cohort of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). The tumor‐promoting function of nodal TAN was probed in the OSCC TCGA dataset combining TAN and epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures. The pan‐carcinoma screening identified a consistent infiltration (59\%) of CD66b+ TANs in tumor‐draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Microscopic findings, including the occurrence of intra‐lymphatic conjugates of TANs and cancer cells, indicate that TANs migrate through lymphatic vessels. In vitro experiments revealed that OSCC cell lines sustain neutrophil viability and activation via release of GM‐CSF. Moreover, by retrospective analysis, a high CD66b+ TAN density in M‐TDLNs of OSCC (n = 182 patients) predicted a worse prognosis. The analysis of the OSCC‐TCGA dataset unveiled that the expression of a set of neutrophil‐specific genes in the primary tumor (PT) is highly associated with an EMT signature, which predicts nodal spread. Accordingly, in the PT of OSCC cases, CD66b+TANs co‐localised with PDPN+S100A9− EMT‐switched tumor cells in areas of lymphangiogenesis. The pro‐EMT signature is lacking in peripheral blood neutrophils from OSCC patients, suggesting tissue skewing of TANs. Our findings are consistent with a novel pro‐tumoral TAN compartment that may promote nodal spread via EMT, through the lymphatics.}},

All cell lines tested internalize NE; however, NE endocytosis is not required for ERK activation. Instead, NE acts extracellularly by stimulating the release of amphiregulin to initiate EGFR-dependent signaling. Inhibiting amphiregulin's biological activity with neutralizing antibodies, as well as gene silencing of amphiregulin or EGFR, attenuates NE-induced migration in normal and benign prostatic cells. Alternatively, in prostate cancer cells, knockdown of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, but not EGFR, impairs both basal and NE-stimulated migration.

We established that neutrophil elastase was expressed by TAN within breast cancer tissues but not by breast cancer cells. Neutrophil elastase modulated killing of breast cancer cells by CTLs specific for CCNE-derived HLA-A2–restricted peptide (ILLDWLMEV). Breast cancer cells exhibited striking antigen-specific uptake of neutrophil elastase from the microenvironment that was independent of neutrophil elastase enzymatic activity. Furthermore, neutrophil elastase uptake increased expression of low molecular weight forms of CCNE and enhanced susceptibility to peptide-specific CTL lysis, suggesting that CCNE peptides are naturally presented on breast cancer cells.

We demonstrated that soluble NE is a specific, high-affinity ligand for NRP1 with a calculated Kd of 38.7 nm. Furthermore, we showed that NRP1 binds to the RRXR motif in NE. Notably, NRP1 knockdown with interfering RNA or CRISPR-cas9 system and blocking using anti-NRP1 antibody decreased NE uptake and, subsequently, susceptibility to lysis by PR1-specific cytotoxic T cells. Expression of NRP1 in NRP1-deficient cells was sufficient to induce NE uptake.

We found that metformin (Met) induces CD11b+-cell-mediated growth inhibition of a K7M2neo osteosarcoma independent of T cells, as growth inhibition of K7M2neo was still observed in wild-type (WT) mice depleted of T cells by antibodies and in SCID; this contrasted with the effect of Met on Meth A fibrosarcoma, which was entirely T-cell-dependent. Moreover, the inhibitory effect seen in SCID was abrogated by anti-CD11b antibody injection. PMN-MDSCs were significantly reduced in both spleens and tumors following Met treatment. In TAMs, production of IL-12 and TNF-α, but not IL-10, became apparent, and elevation of MHC class II with reduction of CD206 was observed, indicating a shift from an M2- to M1-like phenotype via Met administration. Metabolically, Met treatment decreased basal respiration and the oxygen consumption rate (OCR)/extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) ratio of CD11b+ cells in tumors, but not in the spleen. In addition, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and proton leakage in MDSCs and TAMs were consistently observed in tumors. Uptake of both 2-deoxy-2-d-glucose (2-NBDG) and BODIPY® decreased in MDSCs, but only BODIPY® incorporation was decreased in TAMs. Overall, our results suggest that Met redirects the metabolism of CD11b+ cells to lower oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) while elevating glycolysis, thereby pushing the microenvironment to a state that inhibits the growth of certain tumors.}},

Recent advances have identified characteristic genetic features of osteosarcoma, including profound chromosomal disruption, marked patient-patient heterogeneity, and a paucity of recurrent mutations. Analyses suggest genesis in early catastrophic genetic events, although the nature of the inciting events remains unclear. While p53 and Rb inactivation occurs in most osteosarcomas, the landscape of associated driver mutations has proved extensive. Few mutations recur with high frequency, though patterns continue to emerge that suggest recurrent alterations within specific pathways. Biological pathways implicated in osteosarcoma biology through genetic and other preclinical studies include PI3K/mTOR, WNT/βcatenin, TGFβ, RANKL/NF-κB, and IGF. Unfortunately, clinical studies evaluating targeted agents have to date yielded disappointing results, as have studies examining modern immunotherapeutics. It remains unclear whether this pattern of clinical failures exposes inadequacies of our preclinical models, unrealistic expectations for single-agent responses in heavily pretreated patients, or biology less relevant than suggested. Nearly all patients who succumb to osteosarcoma develop lung metastases, which exhibit marked chemoresistance. Much scientific effort has recently sought to enhance our mechanistic understanding of metastasis biology. This research has potential to reveal novel targets for preventing and treating metastasis and for uncovering key vulnerabilities of osteosarcoma cells. Efforts to implement drug development strategies that leverage clinical studies in veterinary patients have potential to accelerate the translation of novel experimental regimens toward human studies. These could reduce costs and development timelines, prioritize agents, and refine regimens prior to human clinical trials. The rise of philanthropic groups focused on osteosarcoma has enhanced cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional focus and provided much needed resources. Transformative new therapies will likely arise from collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts that extend our understanding of osteosarcoma’s most basic inner workings.}},

abstract = {{Surgical resection remains the mainstay treatment for solid cancers, especially for localized disease. However, the postoperative immunosuppression provides a window for cancer cell proliferation and awakening dormant cancer cells, leading to rapid recurrences or metastases. This immunosuppressive status after surgery is associated with the severity of surgical trauma since immunosuppression induced by minimally invasive surgery is less than that of an extensive open surgery. The systemic response to tissue damages caused by surgical operations and the subsequent wound healing induced a cascade alteration in cellular immunity. After surgery, patients have a high level of circulating damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), triggering a local and systemic inflammation. The inflammatory metrics in the immediate postoperative period was associated with the prognosis of cancer patients. Neutrophils provide the first response to surgical trauma, and the production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) promotes cancer progression. Activated macrophage during wound healing presents a tumor‐associated phenotype that cancers can exploit for their survival advantage. In addition, the amplification and activation of myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) or the elevated programmed death ligand‐1 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression under surgical trauma, exacerbate the immunosuppression and favor of the formation of the premetastatic niche. Therapeutic strategies to reduce the cellular immunity impairment after surgery include anti‐DAMPs, anti‐postoperative inflammation or inflammatory/pyroptosis signal, combined immunotherapy with surgery, antiangiogenesis and targeted therapies for neutrophils, macrophages, MDSCs, and Tregs. Further, the application of enhanced recovery after surgery also has a feasible outcome for postoperative immunity restoration. Overall, current therapies to improve the cellular immunity under the special condition after surgery are relatively lacking. Further understanding the underlying mechanisms of surgical trauma‐related immunity dysfunction, phenotyping the immunosuppressive cells, and developing the related therapeutic intervention should be explored.}},

Our results indicate the paucity of our therapeutic armamentarium for this entity, with the majority of the studied modalities resulting in limited or no benefits.

Osteosarcoma is the most frequent primary bone cancer, mainly affecting those of young ages.

We performed a systematic literature review of the available clinical evidence, regarding treatment of recurrent and/or refractory osteosarcoma over the last two decades. Among the 72 eligible studies, there were 56 prospective clinical trials, primarily multicentric, single arm, phase I or II and non-randomized. Evaluated treatment strategies included cytotoxic chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase and mTOR inhibitors and other targeted agents, as well as immunotherapy and combinatorial approaches. Unfortunately, most treatments have failed to induce objective responses, albeit some of them may sustain disease control. No driver mutations have been recognized, to serve as effective treatment targets, and predictive biomarkers of potential treatment effectiveness are lacking.

These effects depended on picomole range of NE activity, sensitive to its natural inhibitor, α1PI. In Elane-negative mice, the lack of NE decreased lung retention of human tumor cells in experimental metastasis. Furthermore, NE was essential for spontaneous metastasis of murine carcinoma cells in a syngeneic orthotopic model of oral cancer. NE also induced tumor cell survival and migration via Src/PI3K-dependent activation of Akt signaling, vital for tumor cell dissemination in vivo. Together, our findings implicate NE, a potent host enzyme specific for first-responding innate immune cells, as directly involved in early metastatic events and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.}},

ELANE proteolytically liberates the CD95 death domain, which interacts with histone H1 isoforms to selectively eradicate cancer cells. ELANE attenuates primary tumor growth and produces a CD8+T cell-mediated abscopal effect to attack distant metastases. Porcine pancreatic elastase (ELANE homolog) resists tumor-derived protease inhibitors and exhibits markedly improved therapeutic efficacy.

Tumor burden was markedly reduced in LSL-K-ras/Elane−/− mice at all time points following induction of mutant K-ras expression. Kaplan-Meier life survival analysis demonstrated that while 100\% of LSL-K-ras/Elane+/+ mice died, none of the mice lacking NE died. NE directly induced tumor cell proliferation in both human and mouse lung adenocarcinomas by gaining access to an endosomal compartment within tumor cells where it degraded insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1). Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that as NE degraded IRS1, there was increased interaction between PI3K and the potent mitogen platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) thereby skewing the PI3K axis toward tumor cell proliferation. The inverse relationship identified between NE and IRS1 in LSL-K-ras mice was also identified in human lung adenocarcinomas, thus translating these findings to human disease. This study identifies IRS1 as a key regulator of PI3K within malignant cells.

Furthermore, we examined the antitumor effect of a specific NE inhibitor, sivelestat. Cell growth assays were carried out in vitro and in vivo using TMK-1 gastric cancer cells. TMK-1 cell growth was stimulated to 118\% of that of the control cells after 48 h stimulation with 1 µg/mL NE according to an MTT assay. Sivelestat inhibited cell growth to 23.4 and 58.0\% of control values at concentrations of 100 and 1000 µg/mL, respectively. NE rapidly phosphorylated EGFR in only 5 min and triggered the ERK1/2–mitogenic signaling pathway in TMK-1. It was further demonstrated that NE-induced EGFR phosphorylation was transactivated through TGF-α, using ELISA. NE increased the cleavage of TGF-α from the cell surface 30-fold compared with the cells without treatment. Interestingly, sivelestat significantly reduced NE-induced EGFR phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation and completely blocked the release of TGF-α from the TMK-1 cell surface. In a xenograft study, the addition of ventrotomy as a surgical stress promoted tumor growth. Sivelestat significantly suppressed the tumor growth induced by surgical stress. These results indicate that sivelestat suppresses the growth of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the release of TGF-α stimulated by NE, which often occurs after surgical stresses.

Fifty-three osteosarcoma pre-treatment biopsies and four osteosarcoma cell lines were evaluated for Tissue Factor expression, and a possible association with clinical parameters was investigated. Tissue Factor function was inhibited in an osteosarcoma cell line (143B) by shRNA knockdown or specific antibodies, and pro-tumourigenic gene expression, proliferation, matrigel invasion and transwell migration was examined. 143B cells were implanted in mice in the presence of Tissue Factor-blocking antibodies, and tumour volume, micro-vessel density and metastases in the lung were evaluated. Tissue Factor was highly expressed in 73.6 \% of osteosarcoma biopsies, and expression associated significantly with disease-free survival. Tissue Factor was expressed in all four investigated cell lines. Tissue Factor was knocked down in 143B cells, which led to reduced expression of IL-8, CXCL-1, SNAIL and MMP2, but not MMP9. Tissue Factor knockdown or inhibition with antibodies reduced matrigel invasion. Tissue Factor antibodies limited 143B tumour growth in vivo, and resulted in decreased intra-tumoural micro-vessel density. Furthermore, lung metastasis from the primary tumour was significantly reduced. Thus, Tissue Factor expression in osteosarcoma reduces metastasis-free survival in patients, and increases pro-tumourigenic behaviour both in vitro and in vivo.

Large numbers of disseminated tumour cells are released from the primary tumour, even during the early stages of tumour growth.

These cells must adapt to a relatively inhospitable microenvironment, evade immune surveillance and progress from the micro- to macro-metastatic stage to generate a secondary tumour. A pervasive driver of this transition is chronic inflammatory signalling emanating from tumour cells themselves. These signals can promote migration and engagement of stem and progenitor cell function, events that are also central to a wound healing response. In this review, we revisit the concept of cancer as a non-healing wound, first introduced by Virchow in the 19th century, with a new tumour cell-intrinsic perspective on inflammation and focus on metastasis. Cellular responses to inflammation in both wound healing and metastasis are tightly regulated by crosstalk with the surrounding microenvironment. Targeting or restoring canonical responses to inflammation could represent a novel strategy to prevent the lethal spread of cancer.}},

Here, we review the current understanding of the role of neutrophils in cancer development, with a specific focus on their pro-metastatic functions. We also discuss the potential and challenges of neutrophils as therapeutic targets. A better understanding the role of neutrophils in cancer will discover new mechanisms of metastasis and develop new immunotherapies by targeting neutrophils.}},

However, no studies elucidated the prognostic relationships between apoptosis-associated genes (AAGs) and osteosarcoma. The differentially expressed genes associated with osteosarcoma metastasis and apoptosis were identified from GEO and MSigDB databases. The apoptosis-associated prognostic signature was established through univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses. The Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curve, ROC curve and nomogram were constructed to investigate the predictive value of this signature. CIBERSORT algorithm and ssGSEA were used to explore the relationships between immune infiltration and AAG signature. The above results were validated in another GEO dataset and the expression of AAGs was also validated in osteosarcoma patient samples by immunohistochemistry. HSPB1 and IER3 were involved in AAG signature. In training and validation datasets, apoptosis-associated risk scores were negatively related to patient survival rates and the AAG signature was regarded as the independent prognostic factor. ROC and calibration curves demonstrated the signature and nomogram were reliable. GSEA revealed the signature related to immune-associated pathways. ssGSEA indicated that one immune cell and three immune functions were significantly dysregulated. The immunohistochemistry analyses of patients’ samples revealed that AAGs were significantly differently expressed between metastasis and non-metastasis osteosarcomas. The present study identified and validated a novel apoptosis-associated prognostic signature related to osteosarcoma metastasis. It could serve as the potential biomarker and therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma in the future.}},

Areas covered: Hypothesis: Unresolved inflammation-induced exaggerated expression of apoptotic and/or wound healing mediators lead to fundamental erosion (‘immune tsunami’ or ‘immune meltdown’) of integrity in tissues that are naturally immune-responsive (immune surveillance); or immune-privileged (immune tolerance). ‘Immune tsunami’ refers to end results of acute or chronic immune dysfunction leading to inflammatory diseases or cancer. Acute inflammatory diseases including drug-induced cancer cachexia, would fit features of ‘immune meltdown’ that are otherwise described for end results of age-associated diseases. Pathogens induce rapid destruction of vascular integrity, gain access to tissues and cause excessive expression of apoptotic factors leading to multiple organ failure (MOF). Significant disruptions of immunological barriers and response shifts lead to chronic neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, tumor growth, malignancies and angiogenesis and loss of natural immune response balances. Expert opinion: Strategies to promote (stabilize) inherent properties of innate immune cells (‘tumoricidal’ versus ‘tumorigenesis’) that would influence polarization of adaptive immune (T or B) cells are key in reducing or preventing incidence of inflammatory and vascular diseases or cancer during aging process.}},

FGFR2 signaling in OSCs initiates fibrosis, whereas the resultant fibronectin (FN) auto-deposition sustains fibrogenic reprogramming and OSC growth, resembling the process employed by non-malignant myofibroblasts to cause tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, we provide evidence that nintedanib targets the pan FGFR-FN axis to disrupt lung metastasis without affecting the bone lesion growth of OSCs.

abstract = {{Ongoing debates, misunderstandings and controversies on the role of inflammation in cancer have been extremely costly for taxpayers and cancer patients for over four decades. A reason for repeated failed clinical trials (90\% ± 5 failure rates) is heavy investment on numerous genetic mutations (molecular false-flags) in the chaotic molecular landscape of site-specific cancers which are used for “targeted” therapies or “personalized” medicine. Recently, unresolved/chronic inflammation was defined as loss of balance between two tightly regulated and biologically opposing arms of acute inflammation (“Yin”–“Yang” or immune surveillance). Chronic inflammation could differentially erode architectural integrities in host immune-privileged or immune-responsive tissues as a common denominator in initiation and progression of nearly all age-associated neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases and/or cancer. Analyses of data on our “accidental” discoveries in 1980s on models of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases in conjunctival-associated lymphoid tissues (CALTs) demonstrated at least three stages of interactions between resident (host) and recruited immune cells: (a), acute phase; activation of mast cells (MCs), IgE Abs, histamine and prostaglandin synthesis; (b), intermediate phase; down-regulation phenomenon, exhausted/degranulated MCs, heavy eosinophils (Eos) infiltrations into epithelia and goblet cells (GCs), tissue hypertrophy and neovascularization; and (c), chronic phase; induction of lymphoid hyperplasia, activated macrophages (Mϕs), increased (irregular size) B and plasma cells, loss of integrity of lymphoid tissue capsular membrane, presence of histiocytes, follicular and germinal center formation, increased ratios of local IgG1/IgG2, epithelial thickening (growth) and/or thinning (necrosis) and angiogenesis. Results are suggestive of first evidence for direct association between inflammation and identifiable phases of immune dysfunction in the direction of tumorigenesis. Activated MFs (TAMs or M2) and Eos that are recruited by tissues (e.g., conjunctiva or perhaps lung airways) whose principal resident immune cells are MCs and lymphocytes are suggested to play crucial synergistic roles in enhancing growth promoting capacities of host toward tumorigenesis. Under oxidative stress, M-CSF may produce signals that are cumulative/synergistic with host mediators (e.g., low levels of histamine), facilitating tumor-directed expression of decoy receptors and immune suppressive factors (e.g., dTNFR, IL-5, IL-10, TGF-β, PGE2). M-CSF, possessing superior sensitivity and specificity, compared with conventional markers (e.g., CA-125, CA-19-9) is potentially a suitable biomarker for cancer diagnosis and technology development. Systematic monitoring of interactions between resident and recruited cells should provide key information not only about early events in loss of immune surveillance, but it would help making informed decisions for balancing the inherent tumoricidal (Yin) and tumorigenic (Yang) properties of immune system and effective preventive and therapeutic approaches and accurate risk assessment toward improvement of public health.}},

The chaotic karyotype of this rare tumor has precluded the identification of prognostic biomarkers and patient stratification. We reasoned that transcriptomic studies should overcome this genetic complexity. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of 79 osteosarcoma diagnostic biopsies identified stable independent components that recapitulate the tumor and microenvironment cell composition. Unsupervised classification of the independent components stratified this cohort into favorable (G1) and unfavorable (G2) prognostic tumors in terms of overall survival. Multivariate survival analysis ranked this stratification as the most influential variable. Functional characterization associated G1 tumors with innate immunity and G2 tumors with angiogenic, osteoclastic, and adipogenic activities as well as PPARγ pathway upregulation. A focused gene signature that predicted G1/G2 tumors from RNA-seq data was developed and validated within an independent cohort of 82 osteosarcomas. This signature was further validated with a custom NanoString panel in 96 additional osteosarcomas. This study thus proposes new biomarkers to detect high-risk patients and new therapeutic options for osteosarcoma. Significance: These findings indicate that the osteosarcoma microenvironment composition is a major feature to identify hard-to-treat patient tumors at diagnosis and define the biological pathways and potential actionable targets associated with these tumors.}},

Despite the emerging evidence related to glucose metabolism in the regulation of prenatal cartilage development, little is known about the role of glucose metabolism and its biochemical basis in postnatal cartilage growth and homeostasis. We show here that genetic deletion of the glucose transporter Glut1 in postnatal cartilage impairs cell proliferation and matrix production in growth plate (GPs) but paradoxically increases cartilage remnants in the metaphysis, resulting in shortening of long bones. On the other hand, articular cartilage (AC) with Glut1 deficiency presents diminished cellularity and loss of proteoglycans, which ultimately progress to cartilage fibrosis. Moreover, predisposition to Glut1 deficiency severely exacerbates injury-induced osteoarthritis. Regardless of the disparities in glucose metabolism between GP and AC chondrocytes under normal conditions, both types of chondrocytes demonstrate metabolic plasticity to enhance glutamine utilization and oxidation in the absence of glucose availability. However, uncontrolled glutamine flux causes collagen overmodification, thus affecting extracellular matrix remodeling in both cartilage compartments. These results uncover the pivotal and distinct roles of Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism in two of the postnatal cartilage compartments and link some cartilage abnormalities to altered glucose/glutamine metabolism.}},

Understanding the level of conservation of inter-tumor transcriptional variation across species and how it is associated with progression to metastasis will enable us to more efficiently develop effective strategies to manage OS and improve therapy. In this study, transcriptional profiles of OS tumors and cell lines derived from humans (n=49), mice (n=103) and dogs (n=34) were generated using RNA-sequencing. Conserved inter-tumor transcriptional variation was present in tumor sets from all three species and comprised gene clusters associated with cell cycle and mitosis and with the presence or absence of immune cells. Further, we developed a novel Gene Cluster Expression Summary Score (GCESS) to quantify inter-tumor transcriptional variation and demonstrated that these GCESS values associated with patient outcome. Human OS tumors with GCESS values suggesting decreased immune cell presence were associated with metastasis and poor survival. We validated these results in an independent human OS tumor cohort and in 15 different tumor data sets obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our results suggest that quantification of immune cell absence and tumor cell proliferation may better inform therapeutic decisions and improve overall survival for OS patients.}},

Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.}},

abstract = {{Single-cell assays have transformed our ability to model heterogeneity within cell populations. As these assays have advanced in their ability to measure various aspects of molecular processes in cells, computational methods to analyze and meaningfully visualize such data have required matched innovation. Independently, Virtual Reality (VR) has recently emerged as a powerful technology to dynamically explore complex data and shows promise for adaptation to challenges in single-cell data visualization. However, adopting VR for single-cell data visualization has thus far been hindered by expensive prerequisite hardware or advanced data preprocessing skills. To address current shortcomings, we present singlecellVR, a user-friendly web application for visualizing single-cell data, designed for cheap and easily available virtual reality hardware (e.g., Google Cardboard, ∼\$10). singlecellVR can visualize data from a variety of sequencing-based technologies including transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data as well as combinations thereof. Analysis modalities supported include approaches to clustering as well as trajectory inference and visualization of dynamical changes discovered through modelling RNA velocity. We provide a companion software package, scvr to streamline data conversion from the most widely-adopted single-cell analysis tools as well as a growing database of pre-analyzed datasets to which users can contribute.}},

Clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, a process termed “efferocytosis,” is ubiquitous in tumors and mediates the suppression of innate immune inflammatory response. Considering the massive infiltrated macrophages in osteosarcoma, efferocytosis probably serves as a potential target, but is rarely studied in osteosarcoma. Here, we verified M2 polarization and PD-L1 expression of macrophages following efferocytosis. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown were used to explore the underlying pathway. Moreover, tumor progression and immune landscape were evaluated following inhibition of efferocytosis in osteosarcoma model. Our study indicated that efferocytosis promoted PD-L1 expression and M2 polarization of macrophages. Ëfferocytosis was mediated by MerTK receptor in osteosarcoma and regulated the phenotypes of macrophages through the p38/STAT3 pathway. By establishing the murine osteosarcoma model, we emphasized that inhibition of MerTK suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the T cell cytotoxic function by increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and decreasing their exhaustion. Our findings demonstrate that MerTK-mediated efferocytosis promotes osteosarcoma progression by enhancing M2 polarization of macrophages and PD-L1-induced immune tolerance, which were regulated through the p38/STAT3 pathway.}},

It currently hosts 287 analysed experiments with 739 perturbation responses with comprehensive downstream analysis. We demonstrate its utility in identifying both known and novel relationships between skeletal expression signatures. SkeletalVis provides users with a platform to explore the wealth of available expression data, develop consensus signatures and the ability to compare gene signatures from new experiments to the analysed data to facilitate meta-analysis.

Via scRNA-seq data, time-related as well as differentiation-related genes were recognized as osteosarcoma tumor stem cell-related genes (OSCGs). In Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohort, osteosarcoma patients were classified into two subtypes based on prognostic OSCGs and it was found that molecular typing successfully predicted overall survival, tumor microenvironment and immune infiltration status. Further, available drugs for influencing osteosarcoma via prognostic OSCGs were revealed. A 3-OSCG-based prognostic risk score signature was generated and by combining other clinic-pathological independent prognostic factor, stage at diagnosis, a nomogram was established to predict individual survival probability. In external independent TARGET cohort, the molecular types, the 3-gene signature as well as nomogram were validated.

In order to develop an accurate treatment for OS, a deeper understanding of its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) is required. In the present study, tissues were isolated from six patients with OS, and then subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using a 10× Genomics platform. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was subsequently used to validate the subsets identified by scRNA-seq. ScRNA-seq of six patients with OS was performed prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and data were obtained on 29,278 cells. A total of nine major cell types were identified, and the single-cell transcriptional map of OS was subsequently revealed. Identified osteoblastic OS cells were divided into five subsets, and the subsets of those osteoblastic OS cells with significant prognostic correlation were determined using a deconvolution algorithm. Thereby, different transcription patterns in the cellular subtypes of osteoblastic OS cells were reported, and key transcription factors associated with survival prognosis were identified. Furthermore, the regulation of osteolysis by osteoblastic OS cells via receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand was revealed. Furthermore, the role of osteoblastic OS cells in regulating angiogenesis through vascular endothelial growth factor-A was revealed. C3\_TXNIP+ macrophages and C5\_IFIT1+ macrophages were found to regulate regulatory T cells and participate in CD8+ T cell exhaustion, illustrating the possibility of immunotherapy that could target CD8+ T cells and macrophages. Our findings here show that the role of C1\_osteoblastic OS cells in OS is to promote osteolysis and angiogenesis, and this is associated with survival prognosis. In addition, T cell depletion is an important feature of OS. More importantly, the present study provided a valuable resource for the in-depth study of the heterogeneity of the OS TME.}},

Based on our study results, pre-treatment NLR, PLR and MLR have diagnostic and prognostic values in osteosarcoma.}},

Current technologies are limited in their ability to characterize the spatial location and gene programs of cells in poorly structured and dynamic niches. We developed a method, NICHE-seq, that combines photoactivatable fluorescent reporters, two-photon microscopy, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to infer the cellular and molecular composition of niches. We applied NICHE-seq to examine the high-order assembly of immune cell networks. NICHE-seq is highly reproducible in spatial tissue reconstruction, enabling identification of rare niche-specific immune subpopulations and gene programs, including natural killer cells within infected B cell follicles and distinct myeloid states in the spleen and tumor. This study establishes NICHE-seq as a broadly applicable method for elucidating high-order spatial organization of cell types and their molecular pathways.}},

abstract = {{Inflammatory response took part in the progression of tumor and was regarded as the hallmark of cancer. However, the prognostic relationship between osteosarcoma and inflammatory response-associated genes (IRGs) was unclear. This research aimed to explore the correlations between osteosarcoma prognosis and IRG signature. The inflammatory response-associated differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) were screened out through Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) databases. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were utilized to construct the IRG signature. The prognostic value of signature was investigated through Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curve and nomogram. DEmRNAs among high and low inflammatory response-associated risks were identified and functional enrichment analyses were conducted. ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment analyses (ssGSEA) were implied to reveal the alterations in immune infiltration. All the above results were validated in Target database. The expression of IRGs was also validated in different cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and osteosarcoma patient samples by immunohistochemistry. The IRG signature that consisted of two genes (MYC, CLEC5A) was established. In training and validation datasets, patients with lower risk scores survived longer and the IRG signature was confirmed as the independent prognostic factor in osteosarcoma. The nomogram was constructed and the calibration curves demonstrated the reliability of this model. Functional analysis of risk score-associated DEmRNAs indicated that immune-related pathways and functions were significantly enriched. ssGSEA revealed that 14 immune cells and 11 immune functions were significantly dysregulated. The qRT-PCR results indicated IRGs were significantly differently expressed in osteosarcoma and osteoblast cell lines. The immunohistochemistry analyses of patients’ samples revealed the same result. The novel osteosarcoma inflammatory response-associated prognostic signature was established and validated in this study. This model could serve as the biomarker and therapeutic target for osteosarcoma in the future.}},

We seek to define distinct features of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment by analyzing single cells from bone metastatic prostate tumors, involved BM, uninvolved BM, and BM from cancer-free, orthopedic patients, and healthy individuals. Metastatic PCa is associated with multifaceted immune distortion, specifically exhaustion of distinct T cell subsets, appearance of macrophages with states specific to PCa bone metastases. The chemokine CCL20 is notably overexpressed by myeloid cells, as is its cognate CCR6 receptor on T cells. Disruption of the CCL20-CCR6 axis in mice with syngeneic PCa bone metastases restores T cell reactivity and significantly prolongs animal survival. Comparative high-resolution analysis of PCa bone metastases shows a targeted approach for relieving local immunosuppression for therapeutic effect.}},

abstract = {{Cancers display significant heterogeneity with respect to tissue of origin, driver mutations, and other features of the surrounding tissue. It is likely that individual tumors engage common patterns of the immune system—here “archetypes”—creating prototypical non-destructive tumor immune microenvironments (TMEs) and modulating tumor-targeting. To discover the dominant immune system archetypes, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Immunoprofiler Initiative (IPI) processed 364 individual tumors across 12 cancer types using standardized protocols. Computational clustering of flow cytometry and transcriptomic data obtained from cell sub-compartments uncovered dominant patterns of immune composition across cancers. These archetypes were profound insofar as they also differentiated tumors based upon unique immune and tumor gene-expression patterns. They also partitioned well-established classifications of tumor biology. The IPI resource provides a template for understanding cancer immunity as a collection of dominant patterns of immune organization and provides a rational path forward to learn how to modulate these to improve therapy.}},

abstract = {{Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.}},

abstract = {{Methylation of N6 adenosine (m6A) plays important regulatory roles in diverse biological processes. The purpose of this research was to explore the potential mechanism of m6A modification level on the clinical outcome of stage III colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were adopted to reveal the signal pathway which was most likely affected by m6A methylation. The linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) method and the least absolute shrink-age and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model were used to identify the signature. The signature can sensitively separate the patients into high and low risk indicating the relapse-free survival (RFS) time based on time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Then, the multi-gene signature was validated in GSE14333 and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. The number of the samples in GSE14333 and TCGA cohort are 63 and 150. Finally, two nomograms were set up and validated to predict prognosis of patients with stage III CRC. The hematopoietic cell lineage (HCL) signaling pathway was disclosed through GSEA and GSVA. Seven HCL-related genes were determined in the LASSO model to construct signature, with AUC 0.663, 0.708, and 0.703 at 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS, respectively. Independent datasets analysis and stratification analysis indicated that the HCL-related signature was reliable in distinguishing high- and low-risk stage III CRC patients. Two nomograms incorporating the signature and pathological N stage were set up, which yielded good discrimination and calibration in the predictions of prognosis for stage III CRC patients. A novel HCL-related signature was developed as a predictive model for survival rate of stage III CRC patients. Nomograms based on the signature were advantageous to facilitate personalized counseling and treatment in stage III CRC.}},

Immune-associated genes between these groups were compared, and an optimal immune-related risk model was built by Cox regression analyses. The deconvolution algorithm (referred to as CIBERSORT) was applied to assess 22 TIICs for their amounts in the osteosarcoma microenvironment. Osteosarcoma cases with high immune score had significantly improved outcome (P<0.01). The proportions of naive B cells and M0 macrophages were significantly lower in high immune score tissues compared with the low immune score group (P<0.05), while the amounts of M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, and resting dendritic cells were significantly higher (P<0.05). Important immune-associated genes were determined to generate a prognostic model by Cox regression analysis. Interestingly, cases with high risk score had poor outcome (P<0.01). The areas under the curve (AUC) for the risk model in predicting 1, 3 and 5-year survival were 0.634, 0.781, and 0.809, respectively.
