# Introduction

-   introduce the reader to the subject area and clarify the knowledge
    gap that the dissertation research will fill.
-   set the context for the dissertation by reviewing the relevant
    literature.
-   include relevant references to general (theoretical papers and
    reviews) and specific (specific to the particular question
    addressed) literature, to justify the research that has been
    undertaken and define the questions being addressed.
-   state the primary research questions and hypotheses in the final
    paragraph.
-   follow an 'inverted triangle' format, progressing from general
    scientific ideas and why they matter to the specific research
    questions addressed in the dissertation project.

*The introduction should not be just a 'Literature Review'.*


Osteosarcomas are one of the most aggressive diseases, characterized by
high tumor heterogeneity and numerous genomic instabilities. They
usually occur in long bones and represent one-fifth of all primary
malignant bone tumors and 2.4% of pediatric cancers [@Fu.2022].
Osteosarcomas occur most frequently in children aged 14-18 years, and
more than 30% of cases, within adults over 40 years of age
[@Mirabello.2009]. The combination of surgery and chemotherapy has
increased the 5-year survival rate of patients to over 70%, however
metastatic osteosarcoma, frequently occurring in the lungs, drops the
survival rate to less than 20%. [@Fu.2022].

The difficulty in treating these tumors is largely due to the genomic instability that characterizes them and that leads to a great inter and intra tumor heterogeneity. Thus, the cancer cells can have various phenotypes. Some tumors are osteoblastic, chondroblastic or fibroblastic dominant.

It is established that tumor cells recruit numerous accessory cell types that will form a stroma that supports tumor growth, metastatic progression and resistance to treatment. Cellular (immune cells) and molecular (cytokines, metabolites) inflammatory mediators play a key role in the tumor stroma. The main immune component has been shown to be M2 macrophages. However, scRNA-seq analyses have revealed other immune cell populations such as neutrophils that are also important mediators of inflammation. Bone tumors are a source of inflammatory factors that serve to recruit and educate the stroma.

An issue that remains poorly documented concerns the heterogeneity of the inflammatory landscape of osteosarcomas and the possible relationships between tumor inflammatory status (TIS) and phenotypic and/or clinical characteristics of these tumors. Similarly, the characteristics of neutrophils associated with bone tumors and their role in tumor inflammation have not been explored to date. 

Recently, immunotherapy has proven to be particularly effective in
treating previously difficult and deadly cancers, and has been promoted
as a medical care therapy in many of them. However, osteosarcomas have
not withstood immunotherapy and have instead turned to conventional
chemotherapy, which is not very effective and has a plethora of side
effects. In order to find a cure for these difficult-to-treat cancers, a
better understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) could
potentially lead to effective and novel targeted TME therapies,
especially since osteosarcomas exhibit high heterogeneity and the
immunological mechanisms of immune resistance are still unknown. Current
advances in bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) have shown their potential in exploring the tumor
microenvironment (TME) to explore intra-tumor heterogeneity and cellular
dialogue between tumor and inflammatory cells.

Neutrophils are the primary innate immune cells recruited during an
inflammation and multiple papers have already elucidated that
tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) or circulating neutrophils are
related to worse patient survival therapy and chemoresistance
[@Faget.2021; @Long.2021]. Neutrophils support cancer development
through 3 pathways : they're able to promote cancer initiation,
assistance of metastasis and increase of tumor growth [@Faget.2021].

# Objective and experimental principle

The study aims to analyze public dataset and to make a custom analysis
using bioinformatic tools in order to understand the cellular crosstalk and
interactions in the TME, between neutrophils and tumor cells and their inflammatory status.

Collaborating with Dr Jean-Marc Schwartz's team in Manchester and Sophie Khakoo, a Master student in Systems Biology, collecting data from a scRNA-Seq dataset, a customized downstream analysis will be performed on
GSE87686 and Target-OS, and a scRNAseq dataset in order to
identify the relationships between neutrophils and osteosarcoma through
the use of genetic signatures available from MSigDB and customized gene
lists.
