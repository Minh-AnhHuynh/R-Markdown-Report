# Introduction

-   introduce the reader to the subject area and clarify the knowledge
    gap that the dissertation research will fill.
-   set the context for the dissertation by reviewing the relevant
    literature.
-   include relevant references to general (theoretical papers and
    reviews) and specific (specific to the particular question
    addressed) literature, to justify the research that has been
    undertaken and define the questions being addressed.
-   state the primary research questions and hypotheses in the final
    paragraph.
-   follow an 'inverted triangle' format, progressing from general
    scientific ideas and why they matter to the specific research
    questions addressed in the dissertation project.

*The introduction should not be just a 'Literature Review'.*

My 4.5 month research internship was dole out under the supervision of
Dr. Dominique MODROWSKI at INSERM U1132 "BIOSCAR" directed by Dr.
Martine COHEN-SOLAL, at the Lariboisière Hospital, a look unit that has
been dedicated to the pathophysiology of bone and cartilage diseases. My
work has focused on elucidating the mechanisms associated with
osteosarcoma and therefore the inflammatory state, with particular
emphasis on neutrophils.

Recently, immunotherapy has been particularly successful in treating
previously difficult and lethal cancers, and was promoted as medical
care therapy in many of them. However osteosarcomas have remained
resilient to immunotherapy, instead looking forward to classical
chemotherapy which is mildly effective and has plethora of side effects.
so as to seek out a cure for difficult to treat cancers, better
understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) could potentially
cause effective and novel targeted TME therapies. Current progress in
RNA sequencing in bulk RNA-Seq and single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) has shown its potential in exploring the tumor
microenvironment (TME), so as to explore intra-tumor heterogeneity and
cellular dialogue between tumor cells and inflammatory cells.
Neutrophils are the primary innate immune cells recruited during an
inflammation and multiple papers have already elucidated that
tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) or circulating neutrophils are
related to worse patient survival therapy and chemoresistance
[\@Faget.2021; \@Long.2021]. Neutrophils support cancer development
through 3 pathways : they're able to promote cancer initiation,
assistance of metastasis and increase of tumor growth [\@Faget.2021].
Neutrophils are first recruited to the TME, through CXCR2 ligands
chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5). Pro-tumor neutrophils support cancer
cells initiation cells by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), RNS
and proteases, and enabling a range of action, like angiogenesis,
protecting tumor cells from antimicrobial factors via NETs, preventing
CD8+ T cell activity through iNOS, arginase 1 secretion (Long et al.,
2021), and facilitation of metastasis through NK cell suppression and
escorting tumor cells. Osteosarcoma is that the most frequent primary
bone tumor with poor prognosis. Epidemiology Extraskeletal osteosarcoma
accounts for \< 1% of all soft tissue sarcomas and approximately 4% of
all osteosarcomas . It typically arises during midlife and late
adulthood, with most patients being within the fifth to seventh decades
of life at diagnosis; occurrence in children is unusual. Males is also
affected more frequently than females (M:F ratio: 0.8-19:1) .
Conventional osteosarcomas (COSs) can arise in any bone, but the
overwhelming majority originate within the long bones of the
extremities, most ordinarily within the distal femur (30%), followed by
the proximal tibia (15%) and also the proximal humerus (15%), i.e. sites
of the foremost proliferative growth plates. In long bones, the tumour
is typically metaphyseal (90%) and only infrequently develops within the
diaphysis (9%) or rarely within the epiphysis. The jaws are the fourth
commonest site of origin . Involvement of the little bones of the
extremities and multifocal osteosarcoma, either synchronous or
metachronous, are rare, the latter representing metastatic spread
instead of multiple independent primary tumours . Telangiectatic
osteosarcomas (TAEOSs) also frequently develop round the knee (-60%) and
within the proximal humerus (-20%) (116). They occur within the
metaphysis, commonly with direct extension into the adjacent epiphysis
and diaphysis. Small cell osteosarcoma (SCOS) encompasses a similar
disMbution but more commonly develops within the diaphysis of long bones
(10-15%) . syndrome, who have an increased incidenee of osteosarcoma.
Patients with hereditary retinoblastoma even have a high risk of
developing osteosarcoma , particularly after receiving radiation
therapy. The genes causing these syndromes are the foremost commonly
mutated genes in sporadic osteosarcoma JP53 in \> 90% and RB1 in as many
as 56% of cases) . Germline mutations in various RECQ helicases underlie
another group of rare syndromes related to COS, including Bloom syndrome
(BLM [FIECQL3]), Werner syndrome (WRN), and Rothmund---Thomson syndrome
(RECQL4) . Acquiring chromosomal instability is additionally the
hallmark of sporadic COS and possibly the foremost crucial step for
initiating and driving tumour development. Syndrome-related COSs are
recognized for an extended time, but the increasing use of DNA
sequencing for genotyping neoplasms and also the germline of people has
identified pathogenic germline mutations in as many as 17.9% of COSs in
larger studies , a figure that's likely to extend in sequencing studies
to come back. There is general consensus about recurring amplifications
for a few regions, like gains of chromosome arms 6p (40- 50% of cases,
harbouring RUNX2, VEGFA, E2F3, and CDC5L [CDC5]), 8q (45-55% of cases,
harbouring MYC), and 17p, which are detected by classic karyotyping and
traditional comparative genomic hybridization, also as deep sequencing.
However, studies are difficult to check because the definition of a
recurrent alteration varies . The TP53 antagonist MDM2 is amplified in
about 10% of cases, suggesting a pre-existing central low-grade
osteosarcoma that underwent dedifferentiation in a minimum of a subset
of cases . FGFR1 amplifications are demonstrated in 18.5% of cases;
alterations within the IGF1R signalling pathway were observed 14% of
COSs . Homozygous loss of CDKN2A occurs in 10% of COSs, is related to an
adverse outcome, and has been implicated in osteosarcoma development
from a mesenchymal progenitor . RB1 is deleted in about 50% of
osteosarcomas . Other recurrently deleted genes include LSAMP, DLG2, and
WWOX . Distinct patterns of large-scale transitions and loss of
heterozygosity paying homage to that seen in BRCA1I BFlCA2-deV are
identified in COS, suggesting a deficiency in homologous recombination
repair (socalled BRCAness) . These findings indicate a possible
sensitivity to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors Gene
expression profiling demonstrated an association between macrophage
expression profiles and lack of metastases, suggesting a beneficial
effect of macrophage infiltration. These findings have also been
confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis . variety of genes are
demonstrated to be hypermethylated in COS, affecting transcriptional
activity HIC1, WIF1, PHLDA2 (TSSC3), RASSF1 (RASSF1A), GADD45. and RUNX2
. Methylation of ER (ESR1) seems particularly interesting, because this
steroid receptor is involved in osteoblastic differentiation. Relieving
ESR1 hypermethylation by DNA methyltransferases resulted in growth
inhibition of tumour cells

# Objective and experimental principle

Previously, the lab has demonstrated that tumor stem cells have specific
properties inside the tumor, characterized by the calpaïne 6 biomarker.
This cell is capable of coordinating invasion of distant tissues and
confers to the whole tumor a specific phenotype.

The study aims to analyze public dataset and to make a custom analysis
using NicheNet in order to understand the cellular crosstalk and
interactions in the TME, between neutrophils and tumor cells, more
specifically, calpaïne 6 tumor stem cells.

Collaborating with Dr Jean-Marc Schwartz's team in Manchester and a M2
in systems biology, bioinformatics, collecting data from available
open-source studies, we will perform a customized downstream analysis on
GSE87686 and TargetOS, PEMRBOSARC and a scRNAseq dataset in order to
identify the relationships between neutrophils and osteosarcoma through
the use of genetic signatures available from MSigDB and customized gene
lists.

NicheNet to identify ligand activity and identify receptors, and predict
their targeted consequences.
